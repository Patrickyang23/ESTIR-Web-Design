        The Electrochemical Society (ECS) has a birthplace of
        historic distinction � Philadelphia � the home of
        <b>Benjamin Franklin</b> (and his famous kite) and the
        birthplace of the United States. The Society originally
        was called the American Electrochemical Society, but,
        like the nation, it had its roots in distant lands. ECS
        was like the nation in other respects. It was a melting pot; in
        this case, a melting pot of scientific and technological disciplines,
        and of their adherents, who came from countries from
        Australia to Mexico to Russia and points in between.
        
        <p><img src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" height="1"> 
        The following photo essay is a distillation of the Society�s
        history � the usual dates, names, and significant markers, but
        also some amusing anecdotes and intriguing photographs.
        We hope you will enjoy this quick look at a society that has
        made its mark on the world of electrochemistry and solid-state
        science and technology.
        
        
        
        <h1><i> Beginnings...</h1></i> 
        
        <p><img src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" height="1"> 
        The Society�s roots can be traced farther back in time than
        when our story begins. Relics found in the Middle East suggest
        that, thousands of years ago, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#v01"> voltaic cells</a> were being used. <a href="art-e01-electroplat.htm"><em> Electroplating</em></a> of some sort is known to have existed in those times as well.
        
        <p><i><b> 1800 </i></b> --- <b>Alessandro Volta</b> concluded that a �<a href="art-v01-volta.htm"><em>pile</em></a>� of dissimilar
        metals provided the electricity responsible for the twitching
        of frogs� legs reported by Galvani.
        
        <p><i><b> 1815 </i></b> --- <b>Humphry Davy</b> used a group of these �piles� to discover and isolate the elements potassium, sodium, and calcium.
        Davy also coined the term �electrochemical.�
        
        <p><i><b> 1831 </i></b> --- <b>Michael Faraday</b> was led to formulate the laws of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f12"> electrolysis</a> and was the first to use the terms <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a02"> anode</a>, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c03"> cathode</a>, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a>, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ion</a>, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c07"> cation</a>, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a04"> anion</a>, and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte</a>. He was the first
        to propose that the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p40"> passivation</a> of iron in concentrated nitric <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a18"> acid</a> was due to the formation of an oxide film.
        
        <p><i><b> 1856 </i></b> --- <b>William Perkin</b> invented the first synthetic dye. The Society of Chemical Industry instituted the Perkin Medal in
        his honor in 1906, and ECS is one of six societies able to nominate
        candidates for the award.
        
        <p><i><b> 1879 </i></b> --- <b>Thomas Edison</b> patented the carbon-thread incandescent lamp. This man of many talents (and patents!) joined ECS in 1903.
        
        <p><i><b> 1886 </i></b> --- <b>Charles M. Hall</b> in the United States and <b>Paul L. T. Heroult</b> in France (both became ECS members) simultaneously
        inaugurated electrolytic processes that had great industrial
        importance: the <a href="art-a01-al-prod.htm"><em> production of aluminum</em></a>.

        <p><i><b> 1888 </i></b> --- <b>Edward Weston</b> formed the Weston Electrical
        Instrument Co. Weston invented the �<a href="../ed/dict.htm#w13">Weston Cadmium Cell</a>�, which became the voltage standard throughout the world,
        and which is depicted in the Society�s official seal. In 1873,
        Weston had adapted the electric generator for electroplating,
        the first important industrial application of electrochemistry
        
        <p><i><b> 1890 </i></b> --- <b>Herbert Dow</b> started the Midland Chemical Co., the first to use electrolytic apparatus to commercially manufacture
        a chemical other than metal; in this case, to extract bromine from brine.
        
        <p><i><b> 1891 </i></b> --- <b>Edward Acheson</b> discovered silicon carbide, which he called carborundum, a better abrasive than any other known
        substance except diamond.
        
        <br clear=left> &nbsp; <p>
        
        <p><i><b> 1901 </i></b> --- Edison formed a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#b01"> battery</a> company and marketed a rechargeable <a href="../ed/dict.htm#n34"> nickel-iron battery</a>. At one time, Edison had a
        rather dim view of rechargeable batteries, judging from a
        quote attributed to him: �The storage battery is� a mechanism
        for swindling the public by stock companies�
        Scientifically, storage is all right, but, commercially, as
        absolute a failure as one can imagine.�
        
        <p><img src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" height="1"> By the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, many talented individuals
        had invented and were building the foundations and
        infrastructures for the communications, electronics, illumination,
        and entertainment revolutions that would come to play
        such important roles in our lives and in the yet-to-be formed
        ECS.

        Feeling the need for a forum at which electrochemical
        matters could be discussed and argued,
        some members of the American Chemical Society
        (ACS) proposed the formation of a new section devoted
        to the field of electrochemistry. ACS demurred.
        One man, <b>C. J. Reed</b>, was especially interested in creating
        a new society as such a forum, and gained the
        support of <b>Joseph W. Richards</b>, a prominent professor
        of metallurgy at Lehigh University. A letter was sent
        to about 30 engineers, chemists, and scientists, soliciting
        members for the new society. The qualifications
        for membership were rather simple � express an interest
        in electrochemistry and pay the $5 annual dues.
        
        <p><img src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" height="1"> &#149; 
        The first meeting of the American
        Electrochemical Society was held
        at the <b>Manufacturers� Club</b> in
        Philadelphia on April 3, 1902;
        it was attended by 52 of the 337
        charter members. A motion to
        organize passed unanimously.
        Richards, the acting chairman, was
        elected president; Reed as secretary;
        P. G. Salom as treasurer; and
        six vice-presidents and seven
        �managers� also were elected. This
        leadership represented a
        good mix of scientific
        and technological disciplines
        and indicated from
        the start that the term
        �electrochemistry� might
        encompass a broader
        range of interests than
        the name implied.

        of papers presented
        at the meetings and of

        was an �excursion� to <b>Thomas Edison�s Laboratory</b>

        agreed, and in response to a letter confirming that

        The four-page monthly <i>American Electrochemical
        Society Bulletin</i> began circulation to the membership.
        It contained such things as lists of individuals
        applying for membership, newly elected members,
        information on meetings, situations wanted, positions
        available, and general news of interest to
        members. Many issues contained listings of patents
        of interest to electrochemists, as well as book
        reviews. <i>The Bulletin</i> was discontinued in 1948,
        with the appearance of the <i>Journal of The

        The agenda for the 1910 fall meeting included an
        evening smoker with entertainment by SECTION
        Q. The special �section" was apparently organized
        by the Canadian <b>W. Lash Miller</b> to �promote intimacy
        and friendship.� It seems that Miller provided
        all members at the initial meeting of Section Q
        with lighted candles and at the appropriate time
        there was a lighted procession to visit a laboratory.
        This was reported to have resulted in much joviality
        � one wonders why, but perhaps it was the bagpipers
        who led the procession. Lawrence Addicks,
        in his Fiftieth Anniversary address, recounted a
        number of other Section Q shenanigans. One was the bribing of two New York City policemen to accompany two hired vaudeville actors in staging a
        mock raid on a technical session in the Chemists�
        Club, to the horror of Carl Hering, �the embodiment
        of gentlemanly reserve.�

        Shortly after the fall meeting, Joseph W.
        Richards died suddenly. The Society held
        an extraordinary meeting in his memory
        in New York City. The Society now
        needed a secretary as dedicated to
        its needs as was Richards.
        Fortunately, <b>Colin C. Fink</b>, who
        had also served as president, was
        such a man. Fink was a hands-on,
        take-charge kind of person. The
        Society was equally fortunate that
        during Fink�s 26-year tenure,
        Columbia University not only allowed
        Fink to pursue his duties as secretary but
        provided sufficient office space to
        house the Society�s operations.
        
        <p><img src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" height="1"> &#149; 
        The Society�s bylaws were
        changed to provide for the formation
        of the Divisions, with representation
        on the Board. Members
        were allowed to register for membership
        in any Division of interest.

        The roots of the <b>High Temperature Materials

        founded as the Electrothermics Division, the first
        formalized division of the Society.

        The fall meeting was held in Montreal.
        Prohibition was the law of the land in the U.S., and
        the Canadian venue was perhaps an attractive one
        for those who enjoyed a little wine with dinner. An
        old-fashioned smoker was on the program, and
        given the venue and the convivial atmosphere,
        there was doubtless a session of Section Q.
        Smoking was quite in fashion in those days and
        smoke-filled rooms were by no means restricted to
        political conventions.

        That drawing (pictured at left) was rejected; but in
        1925, a new design was accepted by the Board. The
        Society seal made its first appearance on the masthead
        of the December 1925 issue of the <i>Bulletin</i>.
        The center field of the design incorporates a

        was a visit to the Niagara Falls Power
        Company. The visitors witnessed a demonstration
        of the power company�s <b>Large Scale

        The model was 1/100<sup>th</sup> of the size of the

        was awarded to <b>F. J. Tone</b>, president of the
        Carborundum Company and a former Society
        president. However, headlines in the

        read, �Franchot Tone�s Father Receives a
        Medal.� Franchot Tone was a leading Hollywood
        actor, who had portrayed characters such Roger
        Byam in the original 1935 �Mutiny on the
        Bounty.� In his final presidential address back
        in 1904, Joseph Richards had referred to
        Tone�s �<a href="../ed/dict.htm#e89">electrometallurgical</a> triumph� of producing silicon: �I had a somewhat uncanny
        feeling when Mr. Tone introduced me to his
        half a ton of silicon� What will be made of
        it? Can it become as useful as iron? Probably not.
        Can application be found for it, which will bring it
        among the ordinary metals of everyday life?
        Possibly.� The answers to his questions would have
        astounded Richards and Tone alike!

        The Niagara Falls meeting presented exhibits of
        products of the electrochemical industries. A former
        president, the eminent <b>Willis R. Whitney</b>, presented
        an entertaining and informative address
        entitled, �More Research.� The talk was wide ranging,
        covering subjects as diverse as turtles, blushing
        shrimp, winking of the eye and the optic nerve,
        battleship communications, and luminaries such as
        Volta and Bacon. Whitney, founder of the General
        Electric Research Laboratories and a Society president,
        was the object of Section Q�s attention at an
        earlier Niagara Falls meeting (1909). Whitney was
        known to be an avid hunter of Indian relics. At a
        picnic down in the gorge, Whitney found a nice
        arrowhead. He then found some other arrowheads
        and naturally became quite enthusiastic. Then he
        found a really good one � made of carborundum!

        The Great Depression and the low level of membership
        in the 1930s raised doubts as to the financial
        solvency and stability of the Society, in spite of
        the dedicated work of Secretary Fink. President R. L.
        Baldwin convened an informal meeting to consider
        whether the Society should dissolve or possibly
        affiliate with ACS. (At one Board of Directors meeting,
        a member reported that he had offered the
        Society to the AIME and that the offer was rejected!)
        The alternative was to continue, with efforts to
        raise more funds, attract new members, and
        improve meeting quality. Needless to say, this latter
        course was chosen.

        <i>Electrochemical Technology</i> began in 1963 in order
        to publish informative technical articles that merited
        publication but did not report original research,
        as was required by the <i>Journal</i>. The first editor, <b>Al
        Loonam</b>, did an outstanding job in launching and
        sustaining the new publication. (When Loonam
        died suddenly in 1965, Norman Hackerman agreed
        to take over the reins of <i>Electrochemical Technology</i> in
        addition to his duties as editor of the <i>Journal</i>.) The
        publication had a relatively short life. A later committee
        recommended that the Society publish only
        the <i>Journal</i>, and that it include three technical sections:
        Electrochemical Science, Solid-State Science,
        and Electrochemical Technology. These recommendations
        were adopted and put in effect in 1969. The
        changes resulted in more economical publication
        and more editorial efficiency.

        One of the members of the Electronics Division

        Although many changes had taken place in publications,
        there was no assured record of papers presented
        at meetings, for Divisions had the option of
        publishing booklets of abstracts from their symposia,

        In the mid-1960s, the question was raised as to
        whether the name of the Society reflected its broad
        interests. There were strong feelings on this matter,
        but the response to a 1967 letter poll was overwhelmingly
        in favor of retaining the current name,
        rather than changing it to another, such as the <b>J.
        Willard Gibbs Society</b>. Back in 1863, Yale
        University had granted its first PhD in science to
        Gibbs. In 1876 and 1878, Gibbs established the
        field of chemical thermodynamics with the publication
        of his treatises on thermodynamics, which
        were to be of great significance to electrochemistry.

        of the category of Fellow. These recommendations

        organized a symposium on Chemical Sensors for the

        <b>Paul A. Kohl</b> became Editor of the <i>Journal</i>. Kohl
        had served as the first editor of <i>Interface</i>, the
        Society�s members� magazine, until his appointment
        to the <i>Journal</i>. Kohl received the Society�s Carl

        Two outstanding past presidents died just a few
        months apart: Charles W. Tobias and N. Bruce
        Hannay. Both had distinguished careers in science
        and technology and contributed greatly to the
        growth and stature of the Society.
        
        <p><img src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" height="1"> &#149; 
        <b>Charles Tobias</b> is credited with founding the
        modern science of <a href="art-e03-engineering.htm"><em> electrochemical engineering</em></a> through his teaching and research at the University
        of California, Berkeley. Tobias contributed to the
        Society in many ways: through presentations of his
        work at meetings and in publications, and his service
        as a leader of the Physical Electrochemistry
        Division and as Society president (1970-1971). The
        Society honored him with numerous awards:
        Edward G. Acheson Award and Prize in 1972,
        Honorary Member in 1977, Henry Linford Award
        for Distinguished Teaching in 1982, and the
        Vittorio de Nora Medal and Prize in 1990.
        
        <p><img src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" height="1"> &#149; 
        <b>N. Bruce Hannay</b> had a distinguished career at
        Bell Laboratories, rising to be vice-president of
        research and patents from 1973 until he retired in
        1982. He was a leader in the research and development
        work that produced practical transistors and
        other solid-state devices. He became involved in
        the Electronics Division of the Society soon after
        the transistor was invented and was influential in
        improving the stature of the Division and in
        attracting to the Society many new members
        involved in the new science and technology of
        <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s73"> semiconductors</a>. Hannay received many honors
        and awards, including the Society�s Edward G.
        Acheson Award and Prize in 1976, the Perkin
        Medal in 1983, and the Gold Medal of the
        American Institute of Chemists.

        The year saw the first meeting of the Society outside
        the U.S. or Canada, and it was the first joint
        venture with the International Society of
        Electrochemistry (ISE). The fall meeting, the largest
        in the Society�s history, was held in <b>Paris, France</b>.
        The meeting was a rousing success, with 2,900 registrants
        and 2,463 papers, though the tragic death of
        Britain�s Princess Diana in Paris added a sobering
        note.

        Although the charter members of the Society had
        long since passed away, a very nice remembrance of
        one of them came in 1997. The Society received a
        large bequest from the estate of <b>Carl Hering</b>, a
        founding member and the Society�s first Secretary.
        The Society placed the money in a separate fund, the
        interest to be used to help support the Centennial
        activities planned for the 2002 spring meeting in
        Philadelphia.

        In July, the rapid-publication online journal,
        <i>Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters</i>, was launched.
        It was the first journal in the field to use a system of
        publishing papers online first �
        one article at a time, as soon as
        they have been accepted and prepared
        for publication � with
        paper publication to follow.
        <i>Letters</i> was the natural outgrowth
        of the former Accelerated Brief
        Communications and the subsequent
        Letters section of the
        <i>Journal</i>. To further ensure its
        success, ECS developed a copublication
        agreement with
        the Electron Devices Society
        of the IEEE. The online publication
        also benefits from an
        arrangement with the
        American Institute of
        Physics (AIP) to produce the
        journal in a special format,
        enabling wide interconnection among all
        online technical journals.
