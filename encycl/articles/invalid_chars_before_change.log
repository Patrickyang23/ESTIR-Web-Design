  Line Content: All people with Type 1 diabetes, and many with Type 2 diabetes, must take additional insulin to control the disease. In order to effectively control Type 1 diabetes, insulin should be injected four or more times daily, including before every meal. This requires frequent self monitoring of the blood glucose <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a>, in order to know how much insulin to inject. Typically, before a meal, the patient measures his blood glucose concentration, then calculates the required insulin dosage, based on (i) the measured glucose value, (ii) planned carbohydrate consumption, (iii) known insulin sensitivity, and (iv) a target glucose concentration. If the blood glucose concentration can be effectively controlled, then the long term complications described above can be forestalled. Self monitoring four times daily costs $1,000 � $2,000/year, although most of this expense is typically reimbursed to the patient.

Thus the control system must be monitored consistently.

  Line Content: In another version of the electric car, the power would be provided by <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cells</em></a>. Fuel cells are somewhat like batteries except that, rather than having a limited amount of chemicals built in, they can be continuously fed by a fuel. A fuel-cell car would be occasionally filled-up by a fuel, much like today�s gasoline-engine cars. The most likely fuel will be hydrogen, but research is being done to use gasoline-like fuels. The most likely earliest, practical commercial application of fuel cells will be power sources for portable electronic devices, lap-top computers, cell-phones, etc. These fuel cells would use alcohol as a fuel; so, rather than occasionally recharging the device from an electrical source, one only will have to insert a new fuel cartridge. The main difficulty with fuel cells is their price. Otherwise, technically reliable and well-working fuel cells have been available for decades: the U.S. space program has been using them routinely, as early as the Apollo program. Of course, in a space capsule price is not the primary consideration, but reliability is.

If you have a pool, you may have a small device to produce locally small amounts of chlorine or bleach, which you need to treat your pool water. Your drinking water is probably treated with chlorine, possibly produced on-site by small electrochemical cells or purchased from companies producing it by brine electrolysis. Chlorine is also a basic ingredient in many plastics, like PVC, used in many homes for piping.

  Line Content: Atoms and molecules consist of a heavy nucleus with electrons swirling around it. The general definition of �oxidation/reduction� is the donation of electrons by one molecule or atom to another. The species that donates the electron is said to be �oxidized�, and the species receiving the electron is said to be �reduced�. Oxidation and reduction always occur together, oxidation is always accompanied by something being reduced, and reduction is always accompanied by something being oxidized. The electron has to go from somewhere to somewhere. These electrons are the same electrons that carry <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electrical currents</a> in the household circuit or any electronic device. Under normal conditions this electron movement between atoms or molecules cannot be used to carry out useful work, the electron movement happens within an extremely short distance; it can be considered an �internal current�. But, if the two parts of the reaction, the oxidation and the reduction, are separated by a large (atomically speaking) distance, and the two reaction sites are connected by a wire for the electrons to travel, now this �external current� can be used to carry out useful work, light a light bulb or run a motor. This is electrochemistry in practice!

  Line Content: One of the simplest examples is the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to produce water. It is well known that hydrogen gas is explosive if mixed with air, the mixture is unstable; all it needs is a spark or a small flame to start the reaction, which than proceeds spontaneously (and explosively) to produce water vapor. In this reaction, electrons move from the hydrogen to the oxygen, but this �electrical current� is useless as far as we are concerned. But this is the same reaction that in a �hydrogen-oxygen� <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cell </em></a> can produce useful current (say to drive an automobile in the future).

  Line Content: There is another type of electrochemical reaction: one that will not proceed unless forced to do so. The reverse reaction of the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell reaction is a good example. Water, which is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, can be decomposed to yield its pure elements. But this is not a spontaneous reaction (at least not under �normal� conditions, that is: at room temperature and atmospheric pressure), it has to be forced by an input of energy. One way to force it is by an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electrical current</a> between two electrodes immersed in some water solution. The reverse reactions of those shown in Figure 1 will occur: hydrogen and oxygen gas will be produced, and they can be collected separately. This is an old technology with many past and present practical uses, for example, the production of oxygen in submarines to refresh the sub�s atmosphere. In <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e02"> this type of electrochemical cells</a>, electrical energy is used to produce a chemical change. See the <a href="#app1"> Appendix</a> for some details about the <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cell</em></a> and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#w01"> water-electrolysis</a> reactions.

The electrode where oxidation occurs (that is, where <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> electrons</a> are donated to the electrode) is called the �anode�, and the electrode where reduction occurs (that is, where electrons are accepted from the electrode) is called the �cathode�.

Or hydrogen could be directly produced from water using the energy of the sunlight in <a href="art-p06-photoel.html"><em> photoelectrochemical cells</em></a>. The hydrogen would be piped to the point of use, either central stations, or individual homes, where fuel cells would turn it back into electricity. The hydrogen could also be used in transportation system (electric cars, etc.) to provide electric power through fuel cells.

  Line Content: Many other chemicals (<a href="art-o01-org-ind.html"><em>organic</em></a> or inorganic) are also produced in electrochemical cells. As already mentioned above, there are always two products generated; both oxidation and reduction must occur at the same time. Unfortunately, often only one of these products is of interest, and the other is a useless byproduct. Nevertheless, these processes are often still provide the most economical choice. There is one notable exemption: the <a href="art-b01-brine.html"><em> electrolysis of brine</em></a> (solution of common table salt). The oxidation reaction produces chlorine gas, while the reduction produces hydrogen gas and with it a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b07"> basic</a> solution (see Eq. [11] in the <a href="#app2"> Appendix</a>), �caustic soda�. Both the chlorine and the caustic soda are useful products. For decades, the hydrogen was generally considered a useless byproduct and was just burned; recently, in some installations the hydrogen is fed to hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells to regain some of the electrical power used in the process; this results in three useful products from one process. Both the chlorine and the caustic are very essential, large scale chemicals, they are used in many chemical processes and products, many of which are for household use. It indicates the scale of the process that it uses about 1.5% of all electrical power generated in the U.S.; among the electrochemical industries this is second only to the <a href="art-a01-al-prod.html"><em> aluminum metal production</em></a>, which uses about twice as much electrical power.

Emphasis is given to the fabrication, classification (according to particle size), safety, packing, and handling of powders. Secondary concerns are with the sampling, packaging, and transportation. Examination of a powder for size and shape are common and important activities in the field of powder technology. Traditional powder consolidation activities include compaction and sintering (a thermal process that increases the strength of a powder mass by bonding adjacent particles via <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d19"> diffusion</a> or related <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> atomic</a> level events). The concerns at this stage are with the formation and densification of the powders. Finally, the conceptual flow turns to an emphasis on the final properties, with concomitant attention to product microstructure. The various scientific and technological aspects of powder metallurgy were recently given by R.M. German (1994).

  Line Content: Electrochemical sensors are the largest group of chemical sensors, representing approximately 58% of the total. Other types include optical (24%), mass (12%) and thermal (6%). This categorization is based on the general transduction principles, that is, how the information is obtained. But it can be misleading, because the term �sensor� is often incorrectly applied to an �analytical assay�, which distorts the count and the overall picture. Both are valid and often useful analytical tools, but there is an important difference. Sensor is a device, which provides information about the sample <u>continuously</u>, while analytical assay yields information in <u>discrete steps</u>. For example, a well-known <a href="art-g01-glucose.html"><em> blood glucose test</em></a>

  Line Content: performed by a diabetic patient is an assay (that is, one value per test), while an enzymatic glucose electrode is capable of following changes of blood glucose continuously, up and down. Generally, a chemical sensor follows the changes of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentration</a> of some chemical in a predictable and continuous fashion. But even that caveat is not always true; a very popular, and useful sensor � the smoke detector, will provide information about �house being on fire� but not about �how much is the house on fire�. Similarly, the pregnancy test (an assay) gives a �yes/no� answer, but not �how much�. So, right at the beginning of this paper we run into problems with definitions and meanings. However, we can agree on certain terminology and its usage and leave the arguments about it to whoever wants to argue about it. A consistency of terminology is most important, in this case.</p>

  Line Content: As the name implies, electrochemistry is about <a href="art-a03-analytical.html"><em>interaction of electricity and chemistry</em></a>. Plenty has been written about this very important area of physical chemistry. Electrochemical sensors are devices that extract information about sample from measurement of some electrical parameter. It is easy to categorize them according to the measured electrical parameter, because the three are linked together by Ohm�s Law (stating that the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e65"> potential difference</a> in a circuit is equal to the product of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a> and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a>, that is, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v07"> volt</a> = <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a15"> ampere</a> times <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o11"> ohm</a>). So, if we measure difference of two potentials (in volts) we talk about �potentiometric sensors�, if the parameter of interest is current (in amperes) we talk about �amperometric sensors�, and if we measure resistance (in ohms) or <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c49"> conductance</a> (the reciprocal of resistance) we talk about �chemiresistors� or �conductometric sensors�. In the following text these three groups of electrochemical sensors are discussed separately. However, they all have two things in common. First, the measurement must be done with closed electrical circuit, meaning that a hypothetical (test) <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charge</a> can be passed through the electrical circuit and returned to its origin. Second, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e77"> electrical neutrality</a> must be preserved. That means that if, for example, a positive charge is added at one place of the closed circuit another positive charge must be taken out (or a negative charge added) somewhere else. A closed electrochemical circuit used for selective determination of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p13"> pH</a> is shown in Figure 1.</p>

  Line Content: A question, which is often asked is, �which is the best sensor�? The true answer to such tricky question is �whichever does the job best�. It means that the application itself always defines the most important performance parameters of a sensor and its quality. This is true of any sensor, not only of electrochemical ones. Nevertheless, there are some performance parameters that are generally more important than the others. We call them <u>figures of merit</u>. At the top of the list is probably <u>selectivity</u>. It is defined as the ability of a sensor to respond to the species of interest, regardless of the presence of other species, which are called <u>interferants</u> (Figure 2). Therefore, if I want to measure <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentration</a> of some <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ion</a>, for example chloride ion, it is much more difficult to measure it in a �dirty� sample, containing many other ions and other chemicals, than in the pure solution containing only dissolved sodium chloride. A good, highly selective sensor will do the job even in the complex sample. The importance of other figures of merit also very much depends on the application. Thus, for example <u>dynamic range</u> is the span of concentrations in which the signal from the sensor matches the concentration of what is being sensed. At concentrations below and above the dynamic range the sensor does not respond. Therefore, concentration of the species defines which sensor can or cannot be used. The speed of response is another important figure of merit, but generally speaking the sensor does not need to be �faster� than the fastest event which is being sensed. We could go on and on, and the details and examples of other figures of merit could be given. The purpose of these examples is to show that they are common to all sensors. Yet, most of these definitions have been developed for electrochemical sensors.
