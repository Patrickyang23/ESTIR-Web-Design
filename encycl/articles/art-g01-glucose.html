                    Diabetes is a condition in which the body either does not produce enough, or does not properly respond to, insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas that enables cells to absorb glucose in order to turn it into energy. In diabetes, the body either fails to make enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes), or does not properly respond to its own insulin (Type 2 diabetes). This causes glucose to accumulate in the blood, leading to complications of the eyes, kidney, heart and circulatory system, among others. In 2007, the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse (NDIC) estimated that 23.6 million people, or 7.8% of the population, had diabetes in the United States, of which about 10% was Type 1, with the remainder mostly Type 2.
                    <p>
                    All people with Type 1 diabetes, and many with Type 2 diabetes, must take additional insulin to control the disease. In order to effectively control Type 1 diabetes, insulin should be injected four or more times daily, including before every meal. This requires frequent self monitoring of the blood glucose <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a>, in order to know how much insulin to inject. Typically, before a meal, the patient measures his blood glucose concentration, then calculates the required insulin dosage, based on (i) the measured glucose value, (ii) planned carbohydrate consumption, (iii) known insulin sensitivity, and (iv) a target glucose concentration. If the blood glucose concentration can be effectively controlled, then the long term complications described above can be forestalled. Self monitoring four times daily costs $1,000 - $2,000/year, although most of this expense is typically reimbursed to the patient.
                    <p>
                    Prior to self monitoring of blood glucose, insulin was usually injected only twice daily by people with Type 1 diabetes, leading to very rudimentary control. The insulin doses were not usually varied, but could be guided over the long term by the measurement of the glucose concentration in urine. Urine glucose measurement is far inferior to blood glucose measurement, since (i) glucose only appears in the urine when it has exceeded a threshold level in blood, which varies from person to person, and (ii) the urine measurement integrates a glucose value over the time required for the bladder to fill.</p>

                        </table>
                        <p>Self monitoring of blood glucose is accomplished using a blood glucose meter and test strips, pictured in Figure 1. Current meters are handheld, with simple intuitive user interfaces that are usually activated automatically by insertion of a test strip. Meters also, to varying extents, have the ability to store, recall, and graph past blood glucose measurements.</p>
                   <p>
                    The user performs the following sequence of steps in order to obtain a blood glucose measurement:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Insert a disposable test strip into the meter, automatically turning the meter on.
                        <li>Lance the skin with a fine sharp to produce a small blood droplet, about one <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m64"> mm</a> in diameter (volume = 0.3 to 5 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m83"> &micro;l</a>)
                        <li>Sample the blood with the test strip, attached to the meter.
                        <li>The meter interrogates the strip in order to measure the blood glucose concentration, typically requiring about 5-10 seconds.
                        </ol>
                      
                        The test strips described in the above procedure can be either optical, in which glucose-derived <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33"> electrons</a> effect a change in the color of an indicating dye <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m34"> molecule</a>, or electrochemical, in which case the glucose-derived electrons are routed directly through the external meter, and counted. For various reasons, including accuracy and the ability to measure extremely small blood volumes, electrochemical strips have gained the advantage in recent years, and now comprise a growing majority of the test strip market.

                <h3> Electrochemical blood glucose test strips (EBGTS)</h3>


                The electrochemical blood glucose test strip (EBGTS) is a very small volume (often about one <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.htm#m83"> Âµl</a> or less) disposable <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e01">
                    electrochemical cell</a>, which is contacted with whole blood. It then produces, in conjunction with
                a test meter, an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c14"> electrical current</a> which is proportional to the
                blood glucose <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a>. Typical currents are a few <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.htm#m18"> ÂµA</a>.
                <p>
                    This electrical current is produced by the very selective <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01">
                        oxidation</a> of glucose in the blood sample, which is <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100">
                        catalyzed</a> by two reagents which are precoated inside the test strip: (i) an enzyme, which
                    reacts directly with the glucose <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m34"> molecule</a> to remove its two
                    available <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a33"> electrons</a>, and (ii) a mediator molecule, which takes
                    (either singly or as a pair) the two electrons from the enzyme, and transports them to the <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02"> working electrode</a>, where they can be measured. This process is
                    illustrated in Figure 2.

                <p>

                    The enzyme and mediator act as a sort of electron bucket brigade to transport electrons from glucose
                    to the working electrode. Each enzyme and mediator molecule can repeat this transfer again and
                    again, if necessary. There are a wide variety of different enzymes and mediators which are suitable
                    for use in an EBGTS, this is discussed in more detail below. Although there are many differences
                    between the various commercially available test strips, they all rely on the fundamental mechanism
                    of Figure 2.
                <p>
                    This approach was pioneered by Anthony Turner at Cranfield University and Allen Hill at Oxford in
                    1984. Their work was first incorporated into a commercially available device in 1988, the ExacTech
                    strip shown in Figure 3.

                    The ExacTech strip was constructed from two <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrodes</a>, one <a
                        href="art-c01-carbon.htm"><em> carbon</em></a> (the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02"> working
                        electrode</a>), and one a mixture of silver and silver chloride (<a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#s06">Ag/AgCl</a>, a combination electrode serving both as the <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#c20"> counter electrode</a> and as the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r06">
                        reference electrode</a>). The working electrode was also coated with a mixture of ferrocene
                    (mediator) and glucose oxidase (enzyme). The electrodes were exposed, unlike current EBGTS, which
                    generally enclose the electrodes in a thin <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c76"> capillary</a> chamber.
                    Therefore the required blood volume (about 10 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m83"> Âµl</a>) was much
                    larger than that used by todayÂ’s strips. The test time, 30 seconds, was also considerably larger
                    than the 5-10 seconds common today. A series of continuous innovations has led to the much improved
                    performance available today.
                <p>
                    Figure 4 shows a representative sample of currently available electrochemical test strips, which
                    vary somewhat in size, but are generally about an inch long and 1/4 inch (about 6 <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#m64"> mm</a>) wide. This size is dominated by ergonomic (handling)
                    concerns, since the actual sample chamber (which fills with blood) is only a few mm long, and is
                    located at the top of the strips in Figure 4. The other (bottom) end of the strips contains
                    electrical contacts for communicating with a blood glucose meter.

                    When blood is added to an EBGTS, and the proper <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e65"> potential</a> is
                    applied across the electrodes, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c14"> current</a> flows as glucose is <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidized</a>. Figure 6 shows the current output that occurs when
                    the test strip of Figure 5 is filled with blood, and a potential of +100 <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#m16"> mV</a> is applied between the working and "counter/referenceÂ”
                    electrodes. The curves rise rapidly, corresponding to the entrance of blood into the strip. In
                    approximately one second, the current peaks, indicating that the strip has filled with blood. The
                    current then decreases, as glucose is consumed, causing its <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c26">
                        concentration</a> in the vicinity of the working electrode to decrease.
                <p>
                    Three different curves are shown, corresponding to low, medium, and high blood glucose levels. The
                    peak currents are proportional to the glucose concentration, although for this particular strip,
                    designed for <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c34"> coulometric</a> analysis, that relationship is
                    non-linear. Instead, the area under the current-time curves varies directly with glucose in a linear
                    fashion.

                <h3> Methods of electrochemical analysis </h3>

                All EBGTS produce a time varying current (like that in Figure 6) which must be analyzed to deduce a
                glucose concentration. However, the method of analysis varies substantially, depending upon the strip
                design. In the broadest sense, the analysis can be either amperometric, in which the instantaneous
                current at a particular time is proportional to glucose, or coulometric, in which the integrated charge
                underneath the entire curve is proportional to glucose.

                <h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" /> Amperometric analysis </em></h3>
                <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a12"> Amperometric</a> strips predominate among electrochemical test strips.
                Typically the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c14"> current</a> is measured 5-15 seconds after the strip is
                filled with blood, and that current level is directly proportional to the glucose <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a>. There are, however, many variations on this theme.
                For example:
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Current can be measured and averaged over a short (a few seconds) interval.
                    <li>Peak current can be measured.
                    <li>A mathematical analysis of the declining portion of the current-time curve (termed a Cottrell
                        analysis) can be performed.
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In general, strips designed for amperometric analysis share some features:
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The surface area and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#s86"> surface roughness</a> of the <a
                            href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02"> working electrode</a> must be highly reproducible to insure
                        that current-time curves are reproducible from strip to strip.
                    <li>The electrode surface-area/sample-volume ratio is low, so that glucose is not substantially
                        depleted in the strip during the analysis.
                    </li>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                <h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" /> Coulometric analysis </em></h3>
                <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c34"> Coulometric</a> strips are less common; they function by exhaustively
                depleting the glucose in the strip. In these strips, the total <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e135">
                    charge</a>, or area under the current-time curve is measured, and is proportional to the glucose
                concentration. Although it may take a considerable amount of time for all the glucose to react, in
                practice the current-time curve assumes a reproducible exponential shape after a few seconds, and can be
                easily extrapolated. This leads to an analysis time similar to that for amperometric strips, about 5
                seconds for the fastest analyses.
                <p>
                    Strips designed for coulometric analysis share some features:
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The internal volume of the sample chamber must be highly reproducible to insure that the
                        analyzed volume is constant from strip to strip. Working electrode <a
                            href="../../ed/dict.htm#s86"> roughness</a> is not a dominating factor, as it is in
                        amperometric strips.
                    <li>The electrode surface-area/sample-volume ratio is high, so that glucose is completely, or almost
                        completely depleted during the analysis.
                    </li>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Coulometric strips have very robust performance, and are less susceptible to external influences
                    such as variable temperature or hematocrit (red blood cell count), although it is possible to
                    compensate for these effects in amperometric strips.


                <h3> Calibration of EBGTS </h3>

                Once a signal, whether <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge</a> or <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c14">
                    current</a>, is extracted from the EBGTS, it must be converted to blood glucose <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a>. This is generally done in a process called
                calibration.
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A series of blood samples are prepared with glucose concentrations spanning the range of
                        interest, typically 200-5000 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m74"> mg</a>/<a
                            href="../../ed/dict.htm#l21">l</a>.
                    <li>The blood samples are tested in a highly accurate laboratory glucose analyzer, called the
                        reference method, to determine the reference glucose value for each sample.
                    <li>The samples are then analyzed in EBGTS, to obtain the characteristic signal, which may be
                        current (<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m18">ÂµA</a>) or charge (<a
                            href="../../ed/dict.htm#m49">ÂµC</a>).
                    <li>The signal (current or charge) is plotted against the reference glucose value.
                    <li>The slope and intercept of the resulting line are used to assign a calibration code to the
                        EBGTS.
                    <li>The user inputs this code into the meter, before self testing, which allows the meter to
                        accurately convert the electrochemical signal to a blood glucose value.

                This process is shown in Figure 7, a plot of charge against reference glucose for a batch of EBGTS. The
                batches can be quite large, several hundred thousand strips, and a few hundred are typically selected at
                regular intervals to test.

                <p>
                    In the calibration above, the strips are tested with whole blood, while the reference value is
                    obtained from plasma derived from the same whole blood samples. This process, known as plasma
                    calibration, allows glucose test strips to report a plasma glucose concentration, even though they
                    are actually filled with whole blood during use.

                <h3> Enzymes and mediators </h3>

                All EBGTS include an enzyme and a mediator, described conceptually above, to ferry <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.htm#a33"> electrons</a> from glucose to the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02">
                    working electrode</a>. However, the actual enzymes and mediators used vary substantially from strip
                to strip. The chemical details of some of the most commonly used ones are described in the <a
                    href="#app"> Appendix</a>.

                <h3> Advanced EBGTS features </h3>

                In addition to the fundamental structural elements described above, many EBGTS are equipped with
                advanced features to enhance the user experience.

                <h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" /> Fill detection </em></h3>

                Most EBGTS are equipped with some means of determining that the sample chamber is entirely filled with
                blood. This is important, because a partially filled chamber can lead to erroneous, generally low,
                results. Older strips relied on visual confirmation of fill, but that process has been automated in
                newer strips. There are three basic ways to accomplish this:
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The combination "<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c20">counter</a>/<a
                            href="../../ed/dict.htm#r06">reference</a>Â” electrode is placed "downstreamÂ” of the <a
                            href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02"> working electrode</a> in the sample chamber. Therefore, as the
                        electrochemical circuit is completed by blood contacting the counter/reference electrode, the
                        working electrode is guaranteed to be completely covered by blood.
                    <li>Dual working electrodes (one downstream from the other) are used. Their outputs are compared,
                        and must correlate closely in order for the strip to be deemed full.
                    <li>Extra <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrodes</a> (beside working and counter/reference) are
                        included, whose function is simply to sense the fluid level. An example is shown in Figure 5.
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                <h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" /> Automatic coding </em></h3>

                Generally, calibration codes, corresponding to a particular batch of strips, are entered into the meter
                by the user, either manually or through insertion of a calibration "chip,Â” that accompanies the strip
                vial. However, it is desirable to entirely bypass this process, since user error is always a
                possibility. Therefore, some EBGTS do not require calibration of any sort. This is generally
                accomplished by:
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Precise manufacturing control of the sensitivity of the produced strips, such that their
                        performance is highly reproducible from batch to batch. In this process, strips are rejected,
                        and disposed of, if their performance does not meet very stringent performance criteria.
                    <li>Adding an indicating mark to the strip that the meter can use to assign a calibration code.
                    </li>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Both systems are currently in use, and automatically coded strips make up an increasing share of
                    EBGTS.

                <h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25" /> Hematocrit correction </em></h3>

                Hematocrit is the percentage, by volume, of red blood cells, in a blood sample. The higher the
                hematocrit, the thicker the blood. Hematocrit affects blood glucose measurements by (i) changing the
                quantity of oxygen dissolved in the blood sample, which can affect strips that use glucose oxidase, and
                (ii) changing the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#v11"> viscosity</a> of the sample, which affects the rate
                at which glucose mediator and enzyme can diffuse and react.
                <p>
                    Historically, measures have been taken during strip design to minimize the hematocrit effect, for
                    example, excluding red blood cells from near the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02"> working
                        electrode</a> surface. An alternate approach is to measure the hematocrit, and correct the
                    reported blood glucose value. For example, hematocrit can be measured by using an extra pair of <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrodes</a> to measure the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c48">
                        conductivity</a> of the blood sample, by applying an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a41"> ac</a>
                    signal between the electrodes. Conductivity is a strong function of hematocrit, so this is an
                    effective form of correction. As regulatory standards become more stringent, this sort of correction
                    is likely to increase.

                Four enzymes are commonly used in these strips, and these are listed in Table I.

                <p>
                    Glucose oxidase was first employed in EBGTS, and is still used in a few commercially available test
                    strips, although its use is declining, since it reacts rapidly with oxygen. EBGTS made with glucose
                    oxidase produce <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c14"> currents</a> that are dependent on the amount of
                    dissolved oxygen in the blood sample, which is heavily dependent on the hematocrit (% red blood
                    cells) in the sample.
                <p>
                    Glucose oxidase has been largely supplanted by the dehydrogenases, which do not react appreciably
                    with oxygen. (In the table above: PQQ, NAD, and FAD refer to the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a33">
                        electron</a> transferring cofactors, which differ between each of the distinct enzymes.) However
                    PQQ-GDH does react with many non-glucose sugars, particularly maltose, which can be elevated in
                    patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. For this reason, use of PQQ-GDH is decreasing, and the FDA
                    has recently restricted its use in new commercial products.
                <p>
                    Both NAD-GDH and FAD-GDH combine oxygen rejection with high specificity for glucose. Their use in
                    EBGTS is increasing. For all the enzymes described, the amount used per strip is typically 1-10
                    enzymatic units, where a unit represents the enzymatic activity capable of <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidizing</a> one <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m84"> micromole</a>
                    of glucose/minute, at 37<sup>o</sup>C (99<sup>o</sup>F). Enzymes typically are deposited on at least
                    the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02"> working electrode</a>, and sometimes on one entire side of the
                    sample chamber, and are codeposited with buffers and stabilizing agents, such as bovine serum
                    albumin.

                <h3><em> <img height="1" src="clear.jpg" width="25" /> Mediators </em></h3>

                A wide variety of mediator is used in EBGTS, but they share certain common features:
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rapid reactivity with both the enzyme and the working electrode material of the particular strip
                        in question.
                    <li>High solubility in blood.
                    <li>Capable of being easily stabilized in the oxidized state; this reduces spurious non-glucose
                        related background currents.

                    </li>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>

                    A few commonly used mediators are: (i) ferricyanide, (ii) 1,10-phenanthroline quinone, and (iii)
                    osmium-based mediators. Their <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o25"> oxidation potentials</a> are 500,
                    100, and -120 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m16"> mV</a> (against <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#s06">
                        Ag/AgCl reference</a>), respectively. But this list is by no means exhaustive. Their chemical
                    structures are shown below.

                    In general, as the potential of the mediator increases, the strip becomes more liable to spurious <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.htm#c14"> currents</a> from electrochemical interferents such as ascorbate,
                    urate, and acetaminophen. In that sense, low potential mediators are more desirable, although
                    alternate strategies (such as a second <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#w02"> working electrode</a> with
                    no deposited enzyme) can be used to quantify, then correct for interferent currents.
