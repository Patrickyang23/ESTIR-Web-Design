                    Tafel's name is an adjective in the language of all trained electrochemists, yet not too many of them would even know his first name. The fame of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#t01">Tafel law</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#t02">Tafel line</a> overshadow Tafel's claim to fame as one of the founders of modern electrochemistry.

            <section>
<h3> His origins </h3>
 

Julius Tafel was born on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of June 1862 in Choindez, a community today part of the Swiss Canton of Jura, at the German-French language border. In 1862 it was the location of the most remote of Von Roll's developing iron and steel works. Tafel's father, Julius Tafel (1827-1893), from a Wurttemberg family in Stuttgart, who had studied chemistry in Tubingen, had became a director of the Choindez works in 1856, from where he moved on to a top management position in the Gerlafingen steel works in 1863 (in the Swiss canton of Solothurn). He went back to Germany with his family in 1875, to found and head the "J. Tafel & Co." steel rolling mills of Nuremberg that existed until 1975. The Julius Tafel Hall is now the center piece of the Nuremberg Industrial Arts Museum.

 

Julius junior attended the Realgymnasium (junior college with scientific orientation) in Stuttgart and Nuremberg, and from 1880 studied chemistry in Zurich, Munich, and Erlangen. Emil Fischer had become a professor in Erlangen in 1882, and Tafel received his Ph.D. under Fischer in 1884, followed Fischer to Wurzburg in 1885 as private assistant, and produced his Habilitationsschrift ("super Ph.D.") in 1888.
<p>
In Fischer's (very simple) private laboratory, Tafel was chief among those working with Fischer on carbohydrate synthesis in the 1880's (Fischer was the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/">1902
Chemistry Nobel Prize</a> winner). Tafel handled the experimental demonstrations when Fischer first reported about this work to the German Chemische Gesellschaft in Berlin in 1890.
<p>
When Fischer moved on to Berlin in 1892, Tafel remained in Wurzburg, a very distinguished university of the time and having many connections to electrochemistry. Hantzsch then had the chair from 1893 to 1903, and Tafel held it from 1903 until 1910. He was succeeded by Buchner (who was the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1907/">1907
Chemistry Nobel Prize</a> winner for his work on fermentation). In the neighboring physics laboratories, the chairs were held in succession by <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k13"> Kohlrausch</a>, Roentgen (the first ever <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/"> Nobel Prize winner of Physics in 1901</a>), <a href="../../ed/dict.html#w09"> Wien</a> (<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/">1911
 Physics Nobel Prize</a>), and Harms. <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f24"> Fick</a> was professor of physiology (until 1899).
<p>
After 1892, Tafel's scientific interest centered on strychnine (a very well known strong poison), purines, and a variety of amino compounds. The laboratory facilities were simple, and Tafel's important health problems, including a chronical phenylhydrazine poisoning, may safely be attributed to poor venting. Tafel's work and methods turned increasingly toward physical and electrochemistry. After time as a guest of Ostwald in Leipzig, he landed the coup - in 1898 - of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reducing</a> strychnine electrochemically at lead <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathodes</a>. Nobody had succeeded in this reduction by chemical means. <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> Electrolytically</a> at lead, one and both oxygen <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> atoms</a> could be replaced by hydrogen atoms. In this way Tafel could show that the two oxygen containing rings were acting in the same sense, to make the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m34"> molecule</a> so highly poisonous. Uric <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a> reduction was another absolute first in 1901.

<h3> 1898: Professor Tafel </h3> 

Until 1893, Tafel had lectured organic chemistry, but after 1893 he lectured physical and general chemistry. By German tradition, this would include lots of electrochemistry, and lots of experimentation. With strychnine reduction, Tafel had truly turned electrochemist. His activities and life took on a new rhythm. He was named a professor in 1898, became extraordinarius in 1902, and a husband, ordinarius, and director of the institute in 1903.
<p>
A careful observer, Tafel soon was able to summarize his major and rather far-reaching general deductions from his experimental work. One can read up on this in an invited review paper in Zeitschrift fur Elektrochemie in 1906. The main points were published already in 1900, and constitute the foundations of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e46">electrocatalysis</a>.

<ol>
<li> Use of a hydrogen <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c39"> coulometer</a> in series with the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e02"> electrolytic cell</a>, in order to deduce from the amounts of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h17"> hydrogen evolved</a> in the chief reaction vessel and in the coulometer whether an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e16"> electrochemical reaction</a> actually took place. The importance of this is: recognition of the factor of <em>time</em> in reactions (the birth of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k01">kinetics</a>), recognition of the factor of <em>yield</em> when working with hard-to-reduce substances. With these findings, Tafel was well ahead of his time. Tafel also would not call the substance being reduced a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d18">depolarizer</a>, as was customary then (and even now): for Tafel, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01">reduction</a> was a competitive act (competition between two reduction reactions) - with the corresponding relative yields of the two reactions.
<p>
<li> Watching out for the effect of <em>impurities</em> showed that lead and mercury (or cadmium) are needed as cathodes for the reduction of hard-to-reduce substances, <b>but</b>
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li> traces of foreign metals have to be excluded from the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathode</a> compartment of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e02"> electrolytic cell</a> in order to obtain reproducible results - they could come from impure lead samples, impure chemicals, and materials dissolving from the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a02"> anode</a>, and these impurities could <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e06">deposit</a> on the surface of the cathode
<li> added traces of platinum halted reduction on lead completely (Tafel calculated that these traces resulted in a 0.2-<a href="../../ed/dict.html#n27">nm</a> layer of platinum deposited on the cathode surface - we now call this <em>submonolayer</em> coverage)
<li> special-quality lead is needed for <a href="art-o01-org-ind.html"><em> organic preparative</em></a> work with electrochemical methods.
</li></li></li></ol>
<p>
All these effects would later be coined <em>catalytic poisoning</em>.
<p>
<li> Observing the anode during work on cathodic reduction, Tafel found that even platinum is not inert as an anode: it readily <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02"> dissolves</a> - in contrast to what Caspari (1989), of Nernst's school, had claimed. It is safe to say that Tafel's observation went unheeded for many decades and well into the space age, fouling up results of research into alternative electrocatalysts. In Tafel's words: "Use of platinum anodes, therefore, represents great danger in all work involving polarization" since the cathodes become "verseucht" ("infested"). <em>This was 1905</em> - more than 100 years ago.
<p>
<li> In their disturbing effects on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolytic</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduction</a> of hard-to-reduce substances at lead, the order of metals is: platinum &gt; silver &gt; tin &gt; copper &gt; mercury &gt; zinc &gt; iron, according to Tafel's early work in 1900. Adding a lead salt during the run could alleviate smaller perturbations, as the cathodic lead <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02"> deposit</a> that forms would cover the contaminant. If the solution was more seriously contaminated, Tafel recommended changing the cathode, but taking it out of the solution <em>without interrupting</em> the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a> - that's what many decades later would be stressed as <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p74">pre-electrolysis</a>.
<p>
<li> For preparing a more productive lead cathode, Tafel (1900) recommended an anodic pretreatment (covering the lead with lead superoxide), followed by cathodic treatment, so as to obtain a spongy, active surface - a <em>cathode pretreatment</em> far safer and more convenient than by chemical means. Cathodes with a more highly developed surface area were less sensitive to contaminants, and more productive in the desired reduction reaction.
<p>
<li> How to determine the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o07">overpotential</a> (for the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h17"> hydrogen evolution</a>) of a metal that everybody was talking about? 

<p><ol type="a">
<li> Set up a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e02"> cell</a> with a given <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathode</a> and a sufficiently well <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> oxidized</a> lead <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a02"> anode</a>. 
<li> Pass a given <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a>, note the steady <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e65"> potential difference</a> being attained. <li> Add platinum solution to the cathode compartment, so that the cathode becomes platinum-covered.
<li> Set the current back to the former value, note the new steady potential difference being attained.
<li> The given cathode's overpotential (relative to platinum) is then known from the difference between the two potential differences (assuming that the platinized cathode has the same overpotential as platinum itself).
</li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
<li> Practical implication: A reduction of an organic substance will only be successful when the cathode's hydrogen overpotential attains or surpasses a certain value. This is because these are competitive reactions and if the overpotential for hydrogen evolution is lower than that for the reduction of the organic substance, the hydrogen evolution will dominate (see the <a href="#app"> Appendix</a>). According to Caspari (of the Nernst school), lead and mercury exhibit the highest hydrogen overpotentials. It was Tafel who recognized how to make use of this phenomenon; C. F. Boehringer (Mannheim) filed patents on this basis in 1902.

</li></p></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></p></p></li></p></li></ol>
Thus, in the 1900 paper of Tafel we have the basic elements of modern views on <em>electrocatalysis, surface preparation, effect of impurities, pre-electrolysis</em>, and the qualitative and quantitative aspects of <em>electrochemical kinetic research</em>.

<h3> The Tafel law </h3> 

It may not be an accident that Tafel completely abstained from using the term <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d18">depolarizer</a>, so much used then and sometimes even now. Certainly a nitro compound in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acidic</a> solution at platinum could look like one - but not so strychnine and caffeine at whatever <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a>! A "depolarizer" should be seen as an electrode <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r17"> reactant</a> which imposes its own electrochemical behavior as the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e66"> potential</a>-determining event. Depolarizer effects require a good measure of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r09">reversibility</a> (fast reaction kinetics!) of the reaction involved. In those days, a depolarizer was a substance that reduced the electrode potential when added to the solution, it was sometimes overlooked that the depolarizer completely changed the electrode reaction, it was <em> itself</em> reacting because its reaction had a smaller overpotential than that of the original reaction taking place without the presence of the depolarizer.
<p>
At around 1900, the stress on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r09">reversible</a> situations had prevented <a <em="" href="art-n02-nernst.html">
Nernst</a> (the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1920/"> 1920 
Chemistry Nobel Prize</a> winner) and coworkers from recognizing the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c100"> catalytic</a> aspects, the effects of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathode</a> material, the nature of the effect of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e66"> electrode potential</a>. That's why there is a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#n02">Nernst equation</a>, reflecting potential-determining reactivity at an electrode, and a <em>Tafel equation</em> - worlds apart and reflecting the effect of imposed electrode potential on resulting reaction rates (<a href="../../ed/dict.html#c09">current density</a>). The Nernst equation is applicable in equilibrium situations when there is no current flowing through the cell, while the Tafel equation is applicable to situations with current flowing (nonequilibrium conditions).
<p>
When the German Electrochemical Society met in Wurzburg in 1902, Tafel was able to provide preliminaries on his experimental inquiries into this topic to the distinguished assembly, but only in 1905 then, an entire issue of the Zeitschrift fur physikalische Chemie was filled with his two papers (112 pages) on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o07"> overpotential</a> and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduction</a> of organic compounds, setting forth the famous law. An invited review paper provided summary in 1906.
<p>
For mercury cathodes and (approximately) for lead and cadmium cathodes, Tafel found the law:
<p>
<img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Î· = a + bÃ—log i
<p>
where “Î·” is the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p06">polarization</a>, “a” and “b” are constants (b = 0.107 for <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h17"> hydrogen evolution</a> in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a27"> aqueous solution</a> at metals, the value increasing with temperature), and “i” is the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c09"> current density</a>. Tafel reported measured data for a wide range of materials and provided ample discussion. He argued that Tafel law was not an obvious consequence of the Nernst equation.
<p>
In this way for the first time, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e47"> electrode kinetics</a> appeared separate from energetics; and made it possible to systematically study <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i10">irreversible</a> reactions. Electrode reactions started to be emancipated from Nernst's electrode potential. In Nernst, a potential is the result of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ionic</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentrations</a> coexisting at the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a>; in Tafel, an applied potential, or in this context rather: overpotential (or applied potential difference), becomes a driving force for reactions <em>changing</em> these concentrations.

</table>
<p>
The empirical equation of the Tafel law is that of a straight-line logarithmic plot if “a” and “b” are constants, see Figure 2. From more complete theoretical equations based on simple <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r15"> mechanisms</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k01"> kinetic</a> behavior, Tafel law can be derived as a limiting case of a more complete and complex electrode kinetics equation (the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b20"> Butler-Volmer equation</a>) that holds above a certain value of overpotential. It holds for many metals and many simple reactions. Below said overpotential, the reverse reaction starts to become important and causes nonlinearity. This onset of nonlinearity is seen in a few of the lines plotted in Figure 2.
<p>
Nonlinearity may also arise when “Î·” varies with “i” for incidental reasons such as changes in the state of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> or changes in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d19"> diffusion</a> conditions. If such changes can be ruled out, then the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#t04">Tafel plot</a> (or Tafel line) and associated values of the constants will admit some kinetic and mechanistic interpretation. Constant “a” can be reformulated in terms of some "standard current density", “i<sub>o</sub>”, usually termed an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e41">exchange current density</a>, and is related to the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r16"> reaction rate constants</a>. Constant “b” (the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#t03">Tafel slope</a>) is the key connection to reaction rate theory, its chief virtue being that the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o07">overpotential</a>, as the driving force, becomes related to the rate (the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c09">current density</a>) of the "driven" reaction - that is, an electrode reaction driven at finite and interesting (useful) rates. With the use of modern rate theories, theoretically derived values of “b” can be compared to the measured value to test proposed <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r15"> reaction mechanisms</a>.
<p>
Complications arise because, actually, signs must be applied in the equation of Tafel law above, and evidently should differ between <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a02"> anodic</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathodic</a> directions. So, rigorously, the plus sign should be replaced by ± (for anodic and cathodic overpotentials, respectively) and “i” should be replaced by “|i|” (the absolute value of “i”). The nonlinearity at low values of overpotential (say, below values of 50 to 100 <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m16"> mV</a>) is caused by the influence of the reverse reaction. In simple cases, a reaction can be driven in either direction, from high cathodic current densities through "zero" all the way to high anodic current densities. "Zero" here implies, not the absence of reaction but the absence of net reaction, where at the electrode, the cathodic and anodic reactions occur at equal rates in opposite directions.
<p>
Tafel, incidentally, had no success in deriving the numerical value of ”b” from theory (that is, from the Tafel <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r15"> mechanism</a>, see the <a href="#app"> Appendix</a>): the cathode potential on mercury and lead was found to increase much faster with current density than it should. On the other hand, ever since, the <b>Tafel law</b> was found to hold for many reactions, and at many more than the metals envisaged for the law by Tafel.
<p>
Tafel spelled out first that the definition of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o07"> overpotential</a> is only meaningful when a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c09"> current density</a> is indicated. (Implicitly: overpotential is a function, not a fixed value!) Overpotentials in Tafel's definition would be referred to the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r13"> reversible hydrogen electrode</a>. Making it a function of current density, he turned attention to electrode reactions as a rate process, such as would be discussed so much later, say, in the famous Horiuti and Polanyi paper of 1935.
<p>
In practical terms, for metals such as lead, cadmium, silver, and copper, Tafel observed states of "activation" and "depression" that depend on the electrode's <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p06"> polarization</a> history, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a37"> anolyte</a> interference, chemical factors, and time factors - certainly, in our more modern view, the obvious effects of changes in the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode's</a> surface state.
<p>
In the 1905 papers, a table of overpotential values was given; it became a classical reference. In connection with his careful observations, Tafel discovered:
<ul>
<p>
<li> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e46"> catalysis</a> takes place, not only with respect to the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h17"> hydrogen reaction</a> but also with respect to the reactions of organic substances
<p>

While the “Tafel Law” was certainly his most lasting and even today very widely known and used contribution to science, he also made many other contributions, some of which are described briefly in the <a href="#app"> Appendix</a>.

<h3> The last years </h3> 

By the time of these discoveries, Tafel had already been forced into early retirement on account of failing health. From 1910 in Munich, he continued helping his pupils and became an eminent book reviewer. The reviews reveal a physical chemist embracing the modern concepts with critical statements regretting a lack of consideration for the theory of reaction rate and chemical equilibrium, the disregard of the phenomena of passivity, the narrow attention to nitro compounds in electrochemical work.
<p>
Aggravating illness, increasing insomnia, the realization that he would not be able to finish a projected modern text of organic chemistry, fear of a complete nervous breakdown led to death by his own hand on 2<sup>nd</sup> of September 1918. His wife Fanny died in Munich in 1968, at the age of 98.

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> The Tafel mechanism </em></h3> 

Organic electrochemistry goes back to Faraday (formation of hydrocarbons during fatty <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolysis</a>, 1834). By 1900 it was widely recognized that platinum was successful as a strongly <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> oxidizing</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a02"> anode</a> (though its benefits were more important for inorganic preparations such as peroxo compounds). A great many <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduction</a> reactions were known by 1900, but most workers studied easy-to-reduce substances at "inert" platinum - and overlooked <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e47">kinetics</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e46"> catalysis</a>, the problems of yields. They also overlooked the highly different behavior of different <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathode</a> materials. It was the organic chemist Tafel who studied hard-to-reduce substances, say, caffeine in an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a27"> aqueous solution</a>:
<p>
[1] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> = C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>12</sub>ON<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
<p>
He recognized that a high <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o07"> overpotential</a> for <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h17"> hydrogen evolution</a> was the prerequisite for succeeding in such reductions, and inquired why. Only metals such as lead (highly pure, in the absence of impurities anywhere in the system, and not having a platinum anode as the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c20"> counterelectrode</a>) could be used. At any cathode, a reaction like [1] will compete with hydrogen evolution (H<sup>+</sup> is a hydrogen <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ion</a> in the solution):
<p>
[2] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> = H<sub>2</sub>
<p>
According to Tafel (1900-1906), [1] may proceed with a measurable rate, only when [2] is sufficiently repressed (slow), "therefore, overpotential values in a given solvent for [2] are a direct measure of the probability of [1] relative to [2], even if nothing is known about the reaction rate of [1]".
<p>
Why could [2] be slow? According to Tafel: "Probably, [2] is a composite reaction of 
<p>
[2a] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> = 2H
<p>
and
<p>
[2b] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> 2H = H<sub>2</sub>
<p>
It should be assumed that the existence of ‘cathodic overpotential', qualitatively and quantitatively, is connected with the combination of 2H to H<sub>2</sub>, and this in fact because of a different <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e46"> catalytic</a> action of metals on this process, which in the case of platinum is particularly strong."
<p>
This <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r15"> mechanism</a>: reaction [2a], hydrogen ion reduction to <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> atomic</a> hydrogen <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a28"> adsorbed</a> on the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> surface, followed by reaction [2b], hydrogen atom recombination to <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m34"> molecular</a> hydrogen on the electrode surface, is the famous <b>Tafel mechanism</b> of hydrogen evolution.

In his systematic work on the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduction</a> of organic substances, Tafel opened routes to many compounds more readily prepared by electrochemical than by chemical methods, often resulting in patents issued in the name of C. F. Boehringer Mannheim. Of special economic significance was the reduction of nitric <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a> to hydroxylamine, making this substance readily available for the first time (1902).
<p>
An important achievement was the preparation of certain hydrocarbons by the reduction of acetoacetic esters (1907). When some hydrocarbons produced did not exhibit the physical constants expected for them on the basis of straightforward chemistry, it turned out that an unexpected anomaly had occurred, which today is known as the <b>Tafel rearrangement</b>:

<tr><td align="right"> rearranged <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="15"/></td></tr>
</table>
<br clear="left"/>   <p>
<p>
In other work, Tafel made first discoveries with respect to metalorganic compounds appearing during certain <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolytic</a> reductions, where di-sec-butylmercury or unsaturated lead alkyls were produced (1911). The surprising scope of Tafel's work can be seen from the citations in Fichter's classical monograph on organic electrochemistry (1942).
