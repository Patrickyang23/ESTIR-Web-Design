  Line Content: An oxide film can be grown on certain metals â“ aluminum, niobium, tantalum, titanium, tungsten, zirconium â“ by an electrochemical process called <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a06"> anodizing</a>. For each of these metals there are process conditions which promote growth of a thin, dense, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b19"> barrier oxide</a> of uniform thickness. The thickness of this layer and its properties vary greatly depending on the metal, with only the aluminum and tantalum (and recently niobium) films being of substantial commercial and technological importance as <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c05"> capacitor</a> <a href="art-d01-dielectrics.htm"><em> dielectrics</em></a>. Aluminum is unique among these metals in that, in addition to the thin barrier oxide, anodizing aluminum alloys in certain <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acidic</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolytes</a> produces a thick oxide coating, containing a high density of microscopic pores. This coating has diverse and important applications including architectural finishes, prevention of <a href="art-c02-corrosion.htm"><em> corrosion</em></a> of automobile and aerospace structures, and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i24"> electrical insulation</a>. In fact, it is this porous coating that is most often thought of as the product of anodizing. Since both barrier and porous oxides can be grown on aluminum, we will use that metal for most of the examples in the discussion that follows. The same principles hold for the growth of barrier oxide on other metals.

  Line Content: An idealized sketch of film structure is shown in Figure 4. The oxide has a cellular structure with a central pore in each cell. The sketch shows uniform hexagonal cells, but most anodization conditions produce films with more disorder, with a distribution of cell size and pore diameter. Cell and pore dimensions depend on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b11"> bath</a> composition, temperature, and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltage</a>, but the end result always is an extremely high density of fine pores. The cell diameter is in the range 50-300 <a href="../../ed/dict.html#n27"> nm</a> and the pore diameter is typically 1/3 to 1/2 of the cell diameter. The cell population density is from approximately 10 to more than 100 per <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m67"> µm</a><sup>2</sup>.

  Line Content: The first use of chlorine for disinfection dates back to 1823, when it was used in hospitals. Chlorine water was employed in obstetric wards to prevent puerperal fever in 1826, and fumigation with chlorine helped to combat the spread of cholera in Europe. Later in the century came the germ theory of disease and the classification of bacteria. In the 1890's, several investigators studied the destruction of bacteria by chlorination of both sewage and potable water. This caused a significant reduction in the incidence of all water-borne diseases. Bleaching powder was used in 1897 to clean polluted mains during a typhoid epidemic in England. When chlorination of drinking water began in Montreal in 1910, there was a 70% decrease in the incidence of âwinter typhoid.â By 1912, the use of chlorine for water treatment had become a common practice. The major turning point for the growth of the chlorine industry was its use in that year for water purification during the Niagara Falls typhoid epidemic.

Later in the century came the germ theory of disease and the classification of bacteria. In the 1890's, several investigators studied the destruction of bacteria by chlorination of both sewage and potable water. This caused a significant reduction in the incidence of all water-borne diseases. Bleaching powder was used in 1897 to clean polluted mains during a typhoid epidemic in England. When chlorination of drinking water began in Montreal in 1910, there was a 70% decrease in the incidence of âwinter typhoid.â By 1912, the use of chlorine for water treatment had become a common practice. The major turning point for the growth of the chlorine industry was its use in that year for water purification during the Niagara Falls typhoid epidemic.

  Line Content: More than 95% of the sodium chlorate produced worldwide is used in pulp bleaching. .Market growth was rapid in the 1990â™s, as the emphasis shifted to elemental chlorine-free (ECF) bleaching. The chlorine previously used in direct bleaching was replaced by chlorine dioxide. The latter is generated by the <a href= "../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a> of sodium chlorate. Because of its reactivity, chlorine dioxide is not handled or shipped in bulk. Rather, it is generated on site from sodium chlorate and captured as a dilute solution in water. The replacement of chlorine in the bleaching process has run its course in North America and Europe, and growth in the sodium chlorate market now is confined to other parts of the world. Asia and South America now account for about 40% of capacity. Sodium chlorate competes for these new markets with hydrogen peroxide and so is favored in places where <a href= "../../ed/dict.htm#e70"> electrical power</a> costs are low. Historically, sodium chlorate has also been used as a herbicide. Accidents due to its <a href= "../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidizing</a> power were frequent, and regulations against its use have nearly eliminated this application. Other uses include the manufacture of chlorites and potassium chlorate and the hydraulic mining of uranium, where chlorate serves as an <a href= "../../ed/dict.htm#o28"> oxidant</a>. Electrolysis of chlorates oxidizes them further to perchlorates, used in pyrotechnics, rocketry, matchheads, etc.

Their principal uses were in refrigerants, propellants, and chemical intermediates. They were produced by reacting chlorine derivatives with HF. Insertion of an atom of fluorine in a CFC or HCFC therefore required prior consumption of chlorine. This market began to disappear after adoption of the Montreal Protocol (1987) to combat the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCâ™s. Carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and some other chlorinated organics have been phased out for the same reason. For practical reasons, HCFCâ™s were the first substitutes for CFCâ™s as refrigerants and aerosol propellants. Replacement was fairly rapid, and the concentration of CFCâ™s in the atmosphere is now declining. HCFCâ™s are imperfect replacements, because they have an ozone depletion potential of their own. It is because this is usually less than 10% of the ozone depletion potential of an equal weight of CFC that the replacement program has been successful. HCFCâ™s are in turn being replaced with hydrofluorocarbons, which have no ODP. Choice of agents now depends on their global warming potential as well. Chemical applications still provide a market for some fluorochemicals. HCFC-22, as an example,is much less harmful than the CFC's towards ozone depletion and is an intermediate in the production of tetrafluoroethylene for use in fluoropolymers.

In-process inventory can be measured by using radioactive mercury as a tracer. The precision of this method is estimated to be 0.5-1%. The uncertainty amounts to 10-20 yearsâ™ worth of emissions. This accounts for variability but does not explain the fact that emission measurements are predominantly lower than mercury purchases. One known reason for the difference is the ongoing accumulation of mercury in the plant (for example, in tank bottoms and by amalgamation with metals). Still, the difference frustrates programs for mercury control. In recent years, operators have placed more emphasis on smaller details, reduced fugitive emissions, increased the recovery of mercury, and formalized standard methods for inventory measurement. The so-called âdifference to balanceâ has decreased from 46 gram/ton in 1977 to an average of about 3 gram/ton over the last decade.

In these, asbestos is mixed with fibers of a fluoropolymer which is fused after being deposited on the cathodes. However, asbestos is a toxic material, causing asbestosis and lung cancer. As a result, many countries decided to ban most uses of asbestos. Chlor-alkali plants generally were exempt because practicable alternatives did not exist. More recently, outright bans or end-dates for the use of asbestos have become common, and its use is at least discouraged. Euro Chlor-BAT, for example, does not recognize the use of asbestos in any form. Partly as a result of this, many diaphragm-cell plants have converted to membrane-cell technology. The remaining diaphragm-cell plants comprise about 25% of the worldâ™s capacity. Some have adopted synthetic diaphragms that contain no asbestos. They generally are based on polytetrafluoroethylene. Some (Polyramix) have zirconium oxide additives; some (Tephram) contain the <a href= "../../ed/dict.htm#i04"> ion-exchange polymer used in membranes</a>. Besides eliminating the asbestos problem, these diaphragms offer longer useful life and lower operating voltage. The latter translates into lower operating cost or the ability to increase production without increasing electrical supply.

  Line Content: Studies in a number of countries have attempted to determine the national cost of corrosion. The most extensive of these studies was the one carried out in the United States in 1976 which found that the overall annual cost of metallic corrosion to the U.S. economy was $70 billion, or 4.2% of the gross national product. To get a feeling for the seriousness of this loss, we may compare it to another economic impact everyone is worried about â“ the importation of foreign crude oil, which cost $45 billion in 1977.

  Line Content: Corrosion rates are determined by applying a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c14"> current</a> to produce a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p48"> polarization curve</a> (the degree of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e66"> potential</a> change as a function of the amount of current applied) for the metal surface whose corrosion rate is being determined. When the potential of the metal surface is <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p06"> polarized</a> by the application of the current in a positive direction, it is said to be anodically polarized; a negative direction signifies that it is cathodically polarized. The degree of polarization is a measure of how the rates of the anodic and the cathodic reactions are retarded by various environmental (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26">concentration</a> of metal <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a>, dissolved oxygen, etc. in solution) and/or surface process (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a28">adsorption</a>, film formation, ease of release of electrons, etc.) factors. The former is called <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c22"> concentration polarization</a> the latter <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a08"> activation polarization</a>. The variation of potential as a function of current (a polarization curve) allows one to study the effect of concentration and activation processes on the rate at which anodic or cathodic reactions can give up or accept electrons. Hence, polarization measurements can thereby determine the rate of the reactions that are involved in the corrosion process â“ the corrosion rate.

When the potential of the metal surface is <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p06"> polarized</a> by the application of the current in a positive direction, it is said to be anodically polarized; a negative direction signifies that it is cathodically polarized. The degree of polarization is a measure of how the rates of the anodic and the cathodic reactions are retarded by various environmental (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26">concentration</a> of metal <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a>, dissolved oxygen, etc. in solution) and/or surface process (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a28">adsorption</a>, film formation, ease of release of electrons, etc.) factors. The former is called <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c22"> concentration polarization</a> the latter <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a08"> activation polarization</a>. The variation of potential as a function of current (a polarization curve) allows one to study the effect of concentration and activation processes on the rate at which anodic or cathodic reactions can give up or accept electrons. Hence, polarization measurements can thereby determine the rate of the reactions that are involved in the corrosion process â“ the corrosion rate.

In Figure 3 the potential "E" is plotted as a function of the logarithm of the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c09"> current density</a> "i".

The values of these characteristic constants in the Tafel equation depend on the metal and the environment under consideration. It is possible to extrapolate the anodic and cathodic linear portions of the polarization curves to the corrosion potential "E<sub>corr</sub>", where, under ideal conditions, they should intersect. The value of the current at their intersection will be the rate of corrosion "i<sub>corr</sub>" expressed in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c09"> current density</a>. The values of the exchange current densities for the cathodic and anodic reactions have a profound effect on the corrosion rate. This is illustrated with an example of using two values of "i<sub>o,c</sub>" (but assuming, for sake of simplicity, that "E<sub>o,c</sub>" is constant): the larger the "i<sub>o,c</sub>" â“ the larger the corrosion rate, "i<sub>corr</sub>" (see Figure 3).

  Line Content: The initiation of a pit occurs when electrochemical or chemical breakdown exposes a small local site on a metal surface to damaging species such as chloride ions. The sites where pits initiate are not completely understood, but some possibilities are at scratches, surface compositional heterogeneities (inclusions), or places where environmental variations exist. The pit grows if the high current density â“ the area of breakdown initiation is exceedingly small â“ involved in the repassivation process does not prevent the formation of a large local concentration of metal ions produced by <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e21"> dissolution</a> at the point of initiation. If the rate of repassivation is not sufficient to choke off the pit growth, two new conditions develop. First, the metal ions produced by the breakdown process are precipitated as solid corrosion products (such as the Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>, <a href="#app1"> Appendix</a>, Equation [7]) which usually cover the mouth of the pit. This covering traps the solution in the pit and allows the buildup of positive hydrogen ions through a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#h21"> hydrolysis</a> reaction (<a href="#app1">Appendix</a>, Equation [5]). Then, chloride or another damaging negative ions diffuse into the pit to maintain <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge</a> neutrality. Consequently, the repassivation becomes considerably difficult because the solution in the pit is highly <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a18"> acidic</a>, contains a large <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a> of damaging ions and metallic ions, and contains a low oxygen concentration.

The usual color change is from pale yellow or colorless (the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduced</a> state) to green or blue (the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidized</a> state); for example, polyaniline absorbs at a wavelength of â‰¤330 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#n26"> nm</a> in its reduced state, the absorbance at ~440 nm increases during the oxidation, and a broad free carrier electron band appears at ~800 nm at more positive potentials. During the oxidation of polypyrrole, the following color changes can be observed: yellow &lt;==&gt; green (420 nm), blue &lt;==&gt; violet (670 nm). However, colorless &lt;==&gt; red (PPD), orange &lt;==&gt; black, or red (470 nm) &lt;==&gt; blue (730 nm) (PT), etc., also occur. This effect can be used in light-reflecting or light-transmitting devices for optical information and storage (displays), or for glare-reduction systems and "smart windows" in cars and buildings. To be applicable in this context, the response time of the conducting polymer must be fast enough (&lt;100 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m22"> m</a>second) and it must be highly reversible upon charging/discharging (for up to 105 cycles or more).

Tuning the color states through modification of the polymer structure has become a basic method in order to achieve multicolor electrochromic displays. The color (that is, the color change) can be tuned by using different derivatives of the same parent monomer.

  Line Content: <p>Hence, the effect of the solution <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r22"> resistivity</a> can be estimated by deriving the dependency of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c09"> current density</a> at the near part of the cathode on current density at the far part of the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c03"> cathode</a> from <em>E</em><sub>cell</sub> â“ <em>j</em><sub>n</sub>, with <em>E</em><sub>cell</sub> â“ <em>j</em><sub>f</sub> dependencies calculated for different resistivities, while all other cell parameters are kept constant. The calculated dependencies are plotted in Figure 16. It can be seen that, besides the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c48"> conductivity</a> of the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte</a>, the kind of the control of the deposition process also determines the current distribution.

  Line Content: The effect of cathodic <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e41"> exchange current density</a>, <em>j</em><sub>0c</sub>, can be analyzed in the same manner. The <em>E</em><sub>cell</sub> â“ <em>j</em><sub>n</sub> and <em>E</em><sub>cell</sub> â“ <em>j</em><sub>f</sub> dependencies were calculated for different cathodic exchange current densities, keeping other parameters constant. The corresponding derived dependencies of the current density at the near part of the cathode on the current density at the far part of the cathode are given in Figure 17. It can be seen that a change in the cathodic exchange current density does not affect the current density distribution (Figure 17). The same should be expected for changes in the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a02"> anodic</a> exchange current density (see Equations [6] and [7]).

Triply charged iron cation is also an oxidizer â“ albeit much weaker â“ that can also be used in successful cases of degradation of grease, cellulose derivatives, urea, meat packing wastes, sewage water, carbonaceous fuels, etc. Cerium ions are well known oxidants used in organic synthesis reactions; they are now used in an environmental application to destroy organic pollutants and munitions residues, converting them into innocuous carbon dioxide. When doubly charged manganese cation is electrochemically oxidized to triply charged cation, these ions can  also oxidize pollutants on their own. Insoluble metallic oxides such as bismuth oxide and cobalt oxide have also been proposed for this application.

  Line Content: Carbon dioxide <a href=  "../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a> is â“ in principle â“ attractive from several stand points. On one hand it is a very abundant substance in the atmosphere, and is a large contributor to the "green house effect". If a synthetic route based on carbon dioxide could be found, not only humanity would have an almost inexhaustible source of raw material, but also the danger of global warming could be greatly reduced. Carbon dioxide is relatively easy to handle, and has very low toxicity. Its reduction products are quite varied according to the reaction conditions, ranging from saturated hydrocarbons (with four or less carbon <a href=  "../../ed/dict.htm#a33"> atoms</a>) and ethylene, to small linear alcohols (with three or less carbon atoms), carbon monoxide, formic acid, and oxalic acid. However, it is not clear at present whether these reactions can ever be made energetically and economically viable.

  Line Content: The recycling of pollutants is one of the main ways in which an industry can balance its productive activity with environmental care. If a process consumes recyclable materials it is advantageous from at least two standpoints, since it does not add to pollution and it recovers useful materials. In this way, electrochemical processes can be used for the recycling of toxic materials used as reagents or <a href=  "../../ed/dict.htm#c101"> catalysts</a> in chemical processes. For example, a highly <a href=  "../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidized</a> chromium species is used as an oxidizer in the synthesis of anthraquinone. The resulting reduced chromium species can then be electrochemically reoxidized, and reused in the main process. A field in which this approach is quite promising â“ and that has not been fully exploited â“ is that of <a href=  "../../ed/dict.htm#b01"> battery</a> and catalyst recycling.

  Line Content: Diversity is conspicuous in the temporal pattern of electric organ discharges (EOD). Some species are called "pulse fish" because the EODs iterate at a low and irregular repetition rate (intervals several to many times the duration of the single pulse). Others are "wave fish" because the intervals are brief and regular (equal to or little longer than discharge duration) â“ reaching regularities higher than any other known biological rhythms. Each discharge is commanded by a special brain <a href="#g-n02"> nucleus</a> that receives and integrates multiple inputs and is usually relayed through one or more <a href="#g-s01"> synapses</a> in the brain stem and again in the spinal cord, besides the last junction between <a href="#g-e03"> efferent</a> <a href="#g-a01"> axon</a> and <a href="#g-e02"> electrocyte</a>. The regularity of the EODs can be controlled by the brain and routinely shows a very small variation.

Some groups of fish are excited by one <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p59"> polarity</a>, for example, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c14"> current</a> entering the skin and inhibited by the other polarity.

Others respond by shortening the response time of the single nerve impulse that follows each brief stimulus ("phase coders or T units"). Each fish typically has all three kinds of receptors â“ ampullary, T, and P units, sometimes answering to only one kind of stimulus â“ social, passive, extraneous, or active distortion of its own EOD by an object of higher or lower <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c49"> conductance</a> than the surroundings.

  Line Content: Electric organs are known in some species of skates (rajoid elasmobranchs) and electric rays (torpinoids), without clear indication whether there was only one or more than one independent "invention". The EOD of skates is weak and probably mainly functions in communication between members of the same species, for example in reproductive behavior. The EOD of Torpedo is high in current but low in voltage and, whatever else it does, certainly contributes to catching prey fish by disorienting their swimming. Electric organs are known in a number of bony fish, including several species and maybe whole families of catfishes (Siluriformes) including one with a strong EOD (Malapterurus), the others being weak, presumably social communicating systems; probably all of the New World knife fishes (Gymnotiformes) which includes the classical, high voltage, low current electric eel (Electrophorus), all species of the African order of Mormyriformes (elephant nose and many others); one family of stargazers (Astroscopidae) with EODs of very moderate strength and quite unknown function. It seems likely that evolution has discovered how to make and make use of electric organs at least five times, independently and possibly more â“ an outstanding case of parallel evolution, possibly exceeded however by the number of plesiomorphic features independently invented for electroreception. Diversity on the motor side includes a variety of forms of innervation of the electrocytes in mormyrids, where these cells have stalks that in some species penetrate the flat disk-like electrocyte and receive motor nerve endings at a circumscribed part of the stalk. Studies of the mitochondrial DNA sequencing of many species permit conclusions about which form of innervation was primitive and which was derived and agree very well with phylogeny based on anatomical characters (Alves-Gomes and Hopkins, 1996).

  Line Content: For many years, there was no special reason to believe that there must be a novel modality for electrosense until it was discovered that many species have a very low voltage EOD, and more convincingly when Lissmann (1958) demonstrated that one of these feeble electric fish can learn to distinguish objects â“ such as two porous ceramic filters one containing a 6 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m64"> mm</a> diameter glass rod and the other a 4 mm rod, invisible through the walls of the filter and hence differing only in electrical impedance, via the active ongoing EOD and sense organs that measure the local strength of the electrical field at different parts of the fish's body surface. The relevant signals are therefore in gradients of hundredths of a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m21"> microvolt</a>/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c109">cm</a> (Machin and Lissmann, 1958, 1960). Even higher sensitivity has been measured, repeatedly, by directly applied electrical pulses in the sea water around some skates and sharks, via their passive electrical receptors; 0.005 microvolts/cm at the peak of a one Hz wave can elicit feeding or orienting behavior (Kalmijn, 2000). Differences between species can be large; one factor being the salinity of the normal habitat. Fresh water forms are generally much less sensitive than sea water animals, perhaps correlated with the greater attenuation of available signals in the high <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c48"> conductivity</a> of sea water.

  Line Content: Electrosensory receptors have evolved in presumably all elasmobranchs, including the truly fresh water rays, as well as in the sister group of the Holocephala (rat fish and chimaeras) and in one group of the agnathans (cyclostomes), the lampreys or petromyzontids, but not in the hagfishes (myxinoids), which are otherwise more advanced in brain differentiation. Thus electroreception contributes to the argument that these two subdivisions of the cyclostomes are unrelated except through remote common ancestors. The only analog of an electric organ discharge in lampreys is the synchronized muscle action potential accompanying each cycle of respiratory movements and one report would suggest that the lamprey uses this synchronized potential as a form of active electroreception (Kleerekoper 1956). Most elasmobranchs lack any analog of an EOD, as far as we know, but they might well detect distortions of their own standing electric fields due to dc fields from the skin, gills and mucous membranes â“ like everything living in a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c50"> conducting</a> medium. The same questions are open for other groups that possess electroreception, but which lack electric organs. This includes the holocephalans, some aquatic salamanders (apodan urodeles), and most of the large and diverse superorder of siluriform teleosts (catfish and others). Several recent discoveries have enlarged the list of catfish that have small electric organs or produce EODs now and then at intervals of many hours â“ requiring special techniques to capture the episodes for analysis (Baron, 2003). At one stage it seemed that having the central and peripheral specializations for electroreception must be a characteristic of the order and would be found in all families of those orders, an exception has turned up (Notopteridae of the Osteroglossiformes) where one suborder (Xenomystinae) has and another (Notopterinae) lacks the ekectrosense. Also puzzling are the stargazers Astroscopus and Uranoscopus. These live, buried in the sand with only the eyes and lips showing, ready to inhale prey fish by suddenly opening the mouth hence, like the long interval catfish, above, have EODs episodically (when a moving shadow coincides with a tap on the wall of the container, simulating a passing fish, Pickens 1964), but seem to lack electroreception (by the usually reliable test of evoked potentials in the midbrain tectum). The EOD is doubtfully strong enough to disorient a passing prey and doubtfully early enough to give sensory guidance to prey catching.

With the intention of making the results of Czechoslovak chemists known abroad, Heyrovsky and his senior friend, Professor Emil Votocek from the Prague Technical University, started in 1929 the monthly journal "Collection of Czechoslovak Chemical Communications", which accepted papers in English and French; the "Collection" kept publishing all important results of the Prague polarographic school. Dissemination of polarography in USA was initiated in 1933 by Heyrovsky, who, as Carnegie Visiting Professor, lectured for five months at universities in California and in the middle and eastern States. In German speaking countries, polarography became first known from a chapter by Heyrovsky, included in 1936 in the second volume of the well known series "Physikalische Methoden der analytischen Chemie", edited by W. Bottger from Leipzig University. The interest in polarography in Soviet Union was spurred by the Russian geochemist A. P. Vernadskii, who sent his coworkers to learn the method in Prague, he also had Heyrovsky's Czech textbook from 1933 translated into Russian, and he invited Heyrovsky to lecture on polarography on the occasion of Mendeleev's 1934 centenary celebrations in Russia. The main pioneer and teacher of polarography in the USA over several decades was Professor Isaak Maurits Kolthoff, an analytical chemist at the University of Minneapolis, Minnesota, he visited Heyrovsky's laboratory several times in the nineteen-thirties, he became interested in the method and wrote a well known textbook on polarography which appeared in two editions and was translated into other languages. The French chemist Dr. Edgar Verdier spent several months in Prague before the outbreak of World War II doing research in polarography; after returning home he wrote the first French textbook on the subject. Thus the knowledge and use of polarography in the world was spreading â“ while by the end of 1930 the polarographic bibliography contained a total number of 125 publications, after ten years it was already at 900.

Czechoslovakia was occupied by the German army, and the Czech universities were taken over by Germans. Thanks to the help of his anti-nazi colleague, German physical chemist Professor Johann Bohm, Heyrovsky was able to continue working in his laboratory.

  Line Content: In addition to the original, or "<a href="../../ed/dict.html#d47">dc</a>", polarography, Professor Bruno Breyer in Australia introduced "<a href="../../ed/dict.html#a41">ac</a>" polarography (Figure 10), in which small amplitude ac <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltage</a> was superimposed on the dc voltage applied to the dropping electrode, and, instead of direct <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a>, the ensuing alternating current was measured, as function of the applied mean dc voltage. Such curves were characterized by maxima, or peaks, in place of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h30"> half-wave potentials</a> of dc polarography. Prominent peaks appeared on the curves also when the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d15"> electrode capacity</a> was changed by fast <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a28"> adsorption</a> or <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d37"> desorption</a> of a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e83"> surface-active compound</a>. Later, placed on a more rigorous basis, two different alternating currents have been recorded separately â“ that flowing in-phase with the applied alternating voltage, and that flowing out-of-phase with it. In that way the complex <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i33"> impedance</a> of the dropping electrode is measured which provides exact data for <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e47"> electrode kinetics</a> in general, and for study of adsorption processes in particular.

  Line Content: Similar to ac polarography, though much more sophisticated in detail, is the "square-wave polarography", developed by Dr. Geoffrey Cecil Barker in the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, UK. Instead of the usual sine-wave shape, the alternating voltage has here a basically rectangular form and the current is measured during the short intervals before each change of the rectangular voltage half-period. This way, the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c21"> charging current</a> has been eliminated to a large extent, and the sensitivity of polarographic determinations was increased by about two orders of magnitude of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentration</a> in the solution. Barker's laboratory became a rich source of further development of polarographic instrumentation. Pulse polarography, and especially its differential version, brought the sensitivity of polarographic analysis to its limit â“ in these methods, a single potential pulse is applied to each mercury drop, and the current, or the difference of currents in the differential version, is measured before the end of drop-time, essentially eliminating the charging current component. "Radio frequency polarography" and "Intermodulation polarography" have been introduced for solving problems in advanced electrode kinetics. Barker combined all his highly complex electronic techniques solely with the dropping mercury electrode, as he trusted its exquisite properties as a scientific tool.

  Line Content: In the nineteen-fifties, several polarographers â“ Drs. Vladimir Cermak and JirÃ­ Vogel in Prague, and Dr. Zenon Kublik and Professor Wiktor Kemula in Warsaw, started using the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h23"> hanging mercury drop electrode</a> instead of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d22"> dropping mercury electrode</a>. That meant that they recorded the whole curve with one single drop of mercury (like in the single-sweep polarography); after the curve was completed, the used drop was knocked off and a new one was produced from the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c76"> capillary</a>. As this time a stationary <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> has been used, according to the official IUPAC nomenclature the method thus introduced is not "polarography" any more, it has to be called "<a href="../../ed/dict.html#v04">voltammetry</a>". The curves are still reproducible, however, unlike the dropping electrode, the hanging drop carries its whole "history" along. This simple fact has been utilized to produce a considerable increase of sensitivity in electroanalysis: using a selected constant potential and controlled stirring, a product of the electrolytic process is quantitatively accumulated at the electrode surface, either in the form of an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a40"> amalgam</a> or in the form of an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a28"> adsorbed</a> layer; after an exactly measured time of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolysis</a>, a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#l04"> linear voltage scan</a> is applied and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c79"> current-voltage curve</a> is recorded, displaying the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e09"> electrode reaction</a> in reverse. This voltammetric operation is known as "<a href="../../ed/dict.html#s47">stripping</a>", of which three modifications are distinguished: <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a02"> anodic</a> stripping (usually <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02"> dissolution of a metal</a> from the previously formed amalgam), <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathodic</a> stripping (usually <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduction</a> of compounds with mercury, previously formed at positive potentials) and adsorptive stripping (usually <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d37"> desorption</a> of species previously accumulated by controlled adsorption). The voltammetric stripping methods allow analytical determinations of species in dilutions as low as one tenth of one billionth <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> molar concentration (M)</a> and lower. Professor Emil Palecek developed the "adsorption transfer voltammetric stripping" in 1986 for electroanalysis of biological macromolecules â“  in this technique, rare substances are accumulated by adsorption from a minute volume (millionth of a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#l20"> liter</a>) of solution to the surface of hanging mercury drop; that electrode with the adsorbed layer is then transferred to a normal cell with usual volume of suitable <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte</a>, for a proper study by some of the stripping techniques. The G. C. Barker's instrumental techniques developed for the dropping electrode can be, and very often are, used with the hanging mercury drop electrode, thus, for example, the very limits of analytical sensitivity can be reached with the differential pulse adsorptive, cathodic or anodic, stripping voltammetry.
