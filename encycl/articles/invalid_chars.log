  Line Content: As summarized in OSullivan (2001), similar complex data has been reported for nickel-tin-phosphorus and nickel-tungsten-phosphorus alloy electroless deposition. Many of the studies in the literature concerning electroless alloys are difficult to comprehend from the viewpoint of deposition <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> and mechanism. This is often due to the nature of the complexant used, which many times functions to complex not only the primary metal ion, such as nickel, but also the secondary metal, or element, ion. Thus, changing the concentration of the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#l22"> ligand</a> in solution changes not only the concentration, or <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a10"> activity</a>, of the free, or hexaquo, metal ion, but also that of the other species of ion undergoing deposition. Also, changing the concentration of the primary metal ion in solution alters the concentration of ligand available for <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c119"> complexing</a> the secondary ion, also changing its free ion concentration, and so on. Having such interdependent concentrations of reacting ions in solution makes it difficult to extract the maximum possible information from fundamental studies of ternary alloy electroless solutions.

These are: disorienting and confusing potential pray and potential predators, or finding pray (even if buried under sand); determining location (electrolocation and electroorientation) by echo or by interaction with the earths magnetic or electric field; social communication (including reproductive behavior); sensing of weather, time of day, earthquakes, and distant lightning. A system of avoiding interaction with each others signal has also been developed as mentioned above.

  Line Content: For many years, there was no special reason to believe that there must be a novel modality for electrosense until it was discovered that many species have a very low voltage EOD, and more convincingly when Lissmann (1958) demonstrated that one of these feeble electric fish can learn to distinguish objects – such as two porous ceramic filters one containing a 6 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m64"> mm</a> diameter glass rod and the other a 4 mm rod, invisible through the walls of the filter and hence differing only in electrical impedance, via the active ongoing EOD and sense organs that measure the local strength of the electrical field at different parts of the fishs body surface. The relevant signals are therefore in gradients of hundredths of a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m21"> microvolt</a>/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c109">cm</a> (Machin and Lissmann, 1958, 1960). Even higher sensitivity has been measured, repeatedly, by directly applied electrical pulses in the sea water around some skates and sharks, via their passive electrical receptors; 0.005 microvolts/cm at the peak of a one Hz wave can elicit feeding or orienting behavior (Kalmijn, 2000). Differences between species can be large; one factor being the salinity of the normal habitat. Fresh water forms are generally much less sensitive than sea water animals, perhaps correlated with the greater attenuation of available signals in the high <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c48"> conductivity</a> of sea water.

  Line Content: Since the two orders that display an active electrosense using their own EODs (the Gymnotiformes and the Mormyriformes) are not closely related and many sister groups have no electric sense, it seems probable that their systems have been independently invented in evolution. The gymnotiforms are close to the siluriforms and might have shared a common ancestral invention. Just possibly the xenomystine knife fishes inherited an invention of the mormyriforms since they both belong to the osteoglossiforms. As few as two parallel inventions within the teleosts can be argued with parallelisms remarkable in their detail. Outside the teleosts, conceivably one single invention has left its mark in the elasmobranch form of ampullary sense organs and central pathways, in the petromyzontiforms through the elasmobranchs and the chondrostei (sturgeons and paddlefish), dipnoans (lungfish), crossopterygians, and brachiopterygians, to the apodan urodele amphibians. Too little, if any behavioral research has been done on most of these groups toward learning what use they make of the sensory system as a passive sense. Exceptions are the elasmobranchs and the paddle fish. In the former, elegant behavioral physiology (Kalmijn, 1982, 2000) has shown under quasinatural conditions it is used for navigation relative to the earths magnetic field as well as to find food fish buried in the sand. In young paddle fish (Polyodon, Acipenseriformes, Chondrostei) it has been shown convincingly that the electric sense guides prey capture even when the prey are small crustaceans about a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m63"> millimeter</a> long (Daphnia), evoking accurately directed capture of single individuals.

Instead of highly corrosive acidic solutions, Bacon used an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a19"> alkaline</a> (potassium hydroxide) electrolyte. He used porous gas-<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d19">diffusion</a> electrodes made of nickel powder. The first alkaline fuel cell, the Bacon cell, was patented in 1959. In 1960 he gave a public demonstration of a fuel cell <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#s16"> stack</a> producing a power of 5-6 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k07"> kW</a>. In order to accelerate the electrochemical processes, Bacon used a high working temperature (more than 200<sup>o</sup>C, 392<sup>o</sup>F) and high gas pressures (up to 40 atmospheres), resulting in a very massive and heavy stack design. Bacons fuel cell demonstration attracted great attention from the scientific and technical community, and in many countries research and development work in this field began on a large scale (the first fuel-cell boom).

  Line Content: As shown in Figure 1, hydrogen (or any easily oxidized fuel to produce protons) is fed to the anode, while oxygen or air is fed to the cathode. The fuel, in this case hydrogen, is oxidized at the anode to produce positively charged protons and negatively charged <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e106"> electrons</a>. The protons can pass through the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#h13"> hydrated</a> PEM to the cathode as <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#h39"> hydronium ions</a>, while the electrons travel along an external circuit, also to the cathode. In this way, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e77"> electro-neutrality</a> (charge balance) is maintained. The protons and oxygen molecules are combined with the electrons at the cathode. Oxygen is reduced by the electrons and combined with the protons to produce pure water and heat. Again, the process can be simplified into separation (anode) and recombination (cathode) of charges, and the associated increase (energy source) or decrease (energy sink) in the systems electrical energy.

  Line Content: Regarding fuel cell history, the German scientist Christian Friedrich Schonbein was the first to publish the principle of its operation in 1838. Sir William Grove then demonstrated the first fuel cell in 1839, and published in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science (<a href="http://electrochem.cwru.edu/estir/history.htm">read the original publications</a>). Figure 2 shows the first electrochemical apparatus demonstrating the fuel cell concept, where oxygen and hydrogen gases are used as the anode and cathode <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r17"> reactants</a>. Many other workers made significant contributions to advancing fuel cell research; however this section will focus specifically on PEM fuel cell history. Grove also proposed that fuel cell reactions needed a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#t24">three phase interface</a> inside the electrode layer (or catalyst layer) where the charged chemicals from the electrolyte, electrons from the electrode current collectors, and neutral chemicals from the fuel or oxidant can all react at the same time. Optimization of this three-phase interface would improve fuel cell performance.

This early fuel cell could also be combined into stacks, and was the basis for todays phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) and PEM fuel cells.

  Line Content: Although Grove invented the fuel cell, it was Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald, one of the founders of physical chemistry, who provided much of the theoretical understanding for how fuel cells operate.  Grove knew optimization of the three phase interface would improve performance, but the theoretical knowledge did not yet exist to explain why.  The interconnected roles of the fuel cells various components (<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a04">anions</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c07"> cations</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidizing and reducing</a> agents, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte</a>, and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrodes</a>) and hence the fundamental knowledge regarding the three phase interface was determined experimentally by Ostwald in 1893. In 1894 he proposed that single step electrochemical energy conversion of hydrocarbon fuels (coal) in a fuel cell is more efficient than thermochemical energy conversion of the same fuel.  However, only theoretical energy conversion was considered and not the more practical aspects such as feasibility and efficiency of coal electrooxidation.  Nonetheless, the foundation for all future fuel cell research was laid by Ostwalds experiments on the underlying chemistry of fuel cells.

As an example, platinum loading has decreased from 28 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m74"> mg</a>/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a> to recently as low as 0.2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>  while simultaneously increasing the power output.  To make the electrodes, the two most common techniques are coating the catalyst ink on either a gas diffusion layer (GDL), or onto the membrane to form a catalyst coated membrane (CCM).  A more detailed method describing how two GDLs are coated with catalyst ink, including PTFE and Nafion, then hot pressed together with the PEM sandwiched in between, has also been used. To make a CCM, other methods have been adapted such as spraying, rolling, and printing processes. After the electrode catalyst layers have been applied to the PEM, GDLs are then affixed to the CCM.  A typical MEA structure is shown in Figure 9.

  Line Content: Also known as the backing layer, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is a critical component in an MEA. Since the GDLs main function is to distribute the reactant gases while providing electronic conductivity, porous conductors such as carbon cloth or paper are commonly used.  The GDL also serves in water management as it removes product water away from the catalyst layer.  The GDL usually has a dual layer structure consisting of a microporous layer next to the catalyst layer and made from carbon powder and a hydrophobic agent (PTFE). Its role is to minimize water flooding and maximize the electronic contact at the interface with the catalyst layer. The second layer is a macroporous carbon substrate consisting of the carbon paper or cloth. A cut away GDL schematic is shown in Figure 10.

In response to ever more strict air quality regulations, car manufacturers like Ford and VW are investing billions of dollars every year on PEM fuel cell development for hybrid electric, and purely electric vehicles. Additionally, PEM fuel cells have been demonstrated in motorcycles, bicycles, and materials handling equipment (forklifts). Most use pure hydrogen through on board high pressure tanks, however liquid fuels such as gasoline and methanol have also been employed with the use of an on board fuel processor or reformer. Recently, development of on board reforming has diminished due to the added system complexity, weight, risk of PEM fuel cell contamination, and decreased efficiency (relative to operation on pure hydrogen).

However, PEM fuel cells are still too expensive, and their life spans too short for wide spread commercialization.

  Line Content: The oxidation of hydrogen on a platinum catalyzed anode is facile relative to the ORR, since it is only a two electron process, and the strength of the single S sigma bond is much weaker compared to that of oxygens SP2 pi bond.  Hydrogen is stripped of its electrons at the anode, and is <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorbed</a> as a hydrogen cation on the platinum surface. A lower oxidation <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o07"> overpotential</a> and a higher <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetic</a> rate are observed for the HOR on platinum catalysts. However, if the hydrogen is reformed from hydrocarbon fuel, reforming byproducts such as carbon monoxide (CO) will adsorb on platinum active sites, reducing the available platinum surface area, effectively deactivating the catalyst. CO at the trace or parts per million (ppm) level in the gas stream will strongly adsorb on the platinum catalyst at the 10 ppm level, adversely affecting anode performance.  High performance PEM fuel cell anode catalysts not only show excellent HOR activity, but also show similar activity in the presence of CO.  Such CO tolerant anode catalysts are created when platinum is combined with oxophilic elements which include ruthenium (Ru), tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), and tin (Sn).  As to why these secondary elements increase the CO tolerance of platinum catalysts, two mechanisms have been proposed.  The first is the bifunctional mechanism, and the second is the electronic effect.  The current choice for CO tolerant HOR catalysts is platinum/ruthenium, however ternary catalysts have also been researched where the third element is added to promote CO oxidation at lower potentials. Tin (Sn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), as well as tungsten oxide (WO), iridium (Ir), rhodium (Rh), osmium (Os), and rhenium (Re) all form the third oxophilic component.

  Line Content: When designing a fuel cell, the key idea is to increase the cells <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e51"> energy</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p20"> power density</a> while also maintaining reliability. In a portable fuel cell, each and every individual component of the fuel cell must be reduced in size proportionately.  This creates issues with the Nafion membrane because when the membrane becomes thin, more fuel crossover occurs. In addition, a Nafion membrane needs to be humidified, which is difficult to maintain without external humidification and operating in a variety of atmospheric conditions. Kohl and coworkers (Moore, ... 2005, Li, ... 2006) proposed a silicon dioxide membrane as a potential solution to this problem because silicon dioxide does not swell with water and is less susceptible to environmental changes or even drying out. The silicon dioxide membrane, however, is a thin glass membrane that is brittle and can be easily cracked or formed defectively. An ideal membrane may be fabricated by layering Nafion on top of silicon dioxide as a composite structure because this helps to ensure long term reliability. They have focused attention on developing such a membrane for a microfabricated fuel cell, and Figure 5 shows their design approach. They have found that by doping silicon dioxide with phosphorus they were able to increase the hydrogen <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ion</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c48"> conductivity</a> of the membrane. They could therefore make the membrane thicker in order to increase the mechanical strength of the membrane without sacrificing any of the cells performance because of the higher membrane resistance.

  Line Content: Electrolyte selection plays an important role in ECM. Sodium chloride, for example, yields much less accurate components than sodium nitrate. The latter electrolyte has far better dimensional control owing to its <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c15"> current efficiency</a> - current density characteristics. Using sodium nitrate electrolyte, the current efficiency is greatest at the highest current densities. In hole drilling these high current densities occur between the leading edge of the drilling tool and the workpiece. In the side gap there is no direct movement between the tool and workpiece surface, so the gap widens and the current densities are lower. The current efficiencies are consequently lower in the side gap and much less metal than predicted from <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f12"> Faradays law</a> is removed. Thus the overcut in the side gap is reduced with this type of electrolyte. If another electrolyte such as sodium chloride solution was used instead, then the overcut could be much greater. Using sodium chloride solutions, its current efficiency remains steady at almost 100% for a wide range of current densities. Thus, even in the side gap, metal removal proceeds at a rate which is mainly determined by current density, in accordance with Faradays law. A wider overcut then ensues.

  Line Content: At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century the technology of artificial illumination, both inside and outside of buildings, had turned into an important subject with a strong impact on the electric industry. In 1879 in the USA Thomas Alva Edison had constructed the first lamp having a carbon filament, and in 1881 he built the first light-bulb factory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. One year later in Germany Emil Rathenau founded a company with the intention to promote the wide use of Edisons invention. In 1887 the <em>Allgemeine Deutsche Elektrizitätsgesellschaft</em> (AEG) emerged from this company. (At the time the company founded by Werner Siemens concentrated exclusively on the fabrication of arc lamps based on the electric discharge between two carbon electrodes). Walther Nernst also participated in the development of the technology for electric illumination. The result of this work was his invention of the Nernst lamp, for which in 1897 he applied for a patent. The Nernst lamp consisted of a glowing piece made of an oxide mixture which was heated by an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electric current</a>. However, in order to achieve the current flow, this piece had to be heated by a separate heating device. Compared to the carbon-arc lamps, the Nernst lamp had the advantage, that the expensive evacuation, required in the production process of the former in order to keep the heated filament from burning, was not necessary. The Nernst lamp could and even had to burn in air. On the other hand, the operation of the Nernst lamp was relatively complicated. Therefore, this technology did not succeed in the long run. However, initially Nernst was able to sell his patent to the AEG. It is estimated that during about half a decade several thousand Nernst lamps were produced per day by the AEG. In 1900 at the World Exhibition in Paris the pavilion of the AEG was illuminated using Nernst lamps.

Apparently during his inaugural lecture in Berlin in August 1905, he announced his perhaps most important discovery, for which he would later receive the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1920/"> Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>: Nernsts Thermal Theorem, which soon afterwards was referred to as the Third Law of Thermodynamics.

Whereas initially Planck felt much discomfort about his revolutionary discovery, it was Einstein who took the quantization of energy literally, in 1905 introducing the concept of the light quanta (photons) and in 1906 extending the quantization to the lattice vibrations in crystals (phonons), published in 1907. Einsteins ideas for the first time explained the fact that at low temperatures the specific heat of crystals strongly decreases with decreasing temperature. In 1912 the Einstein model of the specific heat was much improved by Pieter Debye, who included the complete frequency spectrum of the lattice vibrations in his theory, instead of only the single frequency (Einstein frequency) considered by Einstein.

In the course of the years and with Nernsts frequent visits to the palace, the Kaiser had come to treat him as a personal friend. Now at the height of crisis, Nernst considered it his duty to put before the Kaiser his own depressing analysis of the situation as a warning of doom. He requested an audience which was immediately granted and which took place at Army Headquarters with Hindenburg and Ludendorff present. Nernst outlined the immense boost which the limitless American potential would give to the war effort of the Allies and he compared it with the rapidly dwindling German resources. The Kaiser and Hindenburg listened in silence when Nernst began to speak but Ludendorff interrupted him straightaway.

  Line Content: Taking the example of the Optical Laboratory at the <em>Reichsanstalt</em>, we note again that during the last decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century the artificial illumination turned into a technology having a dominating impact on the electric industry. In addition to the petroleum lamp and gas illumination, the electric light source was coming up. A major breakthrough for the electric lamps occurred after in 1867 Werner Siemens had discovered the electrodynamic principle of the generation of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electric current</a>. Due to these developments there existed a strong need for improvements of photometry and the quantitative measurements of light intensity, leading to generally accepted standards for this quantity. As a result the Optical Laboratory of the <em>Reichsanstalt</em> was instituted and charged with the tasks we have just indicated. The measurements of the frequency distribution of the intensity of the black-body radiation then lead to Max Plancks (the

  Line Content: Already in 1920 Walther Meissner, head of the Low-Temperature Laboratory, had considered the possibility to install a facility for the liquefaction of helium and thereby extending the available temperature range to lower values. During March 1925 helium was liquefied at the <em>Reichsanstalt</em> for the first time. Worldwide Meissners laboratory was the third location, where experiments in the temperature range of liquid helium could be performed (after Leiden in Holland and Toronto in Canada). One of the important subjects studied by Meissner dealt with the low-temperature phenomenon of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s74"> superconductivity</a>, and he succeeded in discovering about half a dozen new superconductors. In addition to looking for new superconducting materials, Meissner was also interested in their fundamental and particularly in their magnetic properties. In this context he was supported by Max von Laue, who suggested accurate magnetic-field measurements near the surface of a superconductor during the superconducting phase-transition. The result of this endeavor was the discovery of the Meissner effect, which is the complete expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of a superconductor. This effect represents the most fundamental property of a superconductor, and its discovery was a turning point in the field. Now superconductivity could be understood in terms of a new phase in thermodynamic equilibrium, and subsequently the theory advanced in great steps. The role of Walther Nernst in bringing in Max von Laue cannot be overemphasized.

In his Institute of Experimental Physics Nernst turned to problems of astrophysics and to the cosmological implications of the second law of thermodynamics. He had developed an interest in these subjects already as a student in Graz in 1886, when he read the text of the inaugural lecture by Ludwig Boltzmann at the Academy in Vienna. In this lecture Boltzmann discussed the heat death of the universe as an unavoidable consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.

This invention dealt with the electronic generation of music, and Nernst was able to arrange a cooperation with the Siemens &amp; Halske Company. Among the early electronic musical instruments Nernsts grand piano was the most successful economically, because it was produced only in series of 150 copies. Immediately after the announcement of the instrument, 10 instruments were bought by the American entertainment industry. Also the radio stations used the grand piano for some time. Today functioning Neo-Bechstein Grand Pianos from the 1930s can be found only in museums.

  Line Content: One of the initial discoveries that led to the field of photoelectrochemistry was made by Becquerel, (1839) who observed a photocurrent, that is, a flow of electrons upon illumination with light, between two <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrodes</a> immersed in solution. In the 1950s researchers at Bell Labs began to study high purity crystals of germanium and silicon semiconductors, developing models for their electronic behavior. In the 1970s Professor Heinz Gerischer began systematic studies of the behavior of semiconductors immersed in liquid solutions. High efficiency regenerative (electricity producing) photoelectrochemical cells were developed in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents in the 1980's by Lewis et al.  A record energy conversion efficiency for a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#w01"> water-splitting</a> photoelectrochemical device was reported by Turner and Khaselev at the National Renewable Energy Lab in 1998.  This particular device was unstable over periods of hours, but displayed a conversion efficiency of 12.4% (light energy to chemical energy). Efficient <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p34"> photoelectrochemical cells</a> based on dye sensitization were first reported by Gratzel and ORegan in 1991. These so-called dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) convert light energy into electricity and are thus regenerative photoelectrochemical cells.

As the name implies the electrode is selective for one ion, in preference to other ions. The mother of all ion-selective electrodes is the glass electrode, which is selectively sensitive to hydrogen ions (<a href="../../ed/dict.html#p13">pH</a>). It has an astonishing dynamic range of ~36 pH units, it is highly selective, that is, only very few other ions would interfere, and it is also the oldest of all electrochemical sensors. Its first description appeared in 1909 (Haber). Because it has very high <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a> (millions of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o11"> ohms</a>), due to its thin glass membrane, it requires a high input <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i33"> impedance</a> amplifier for its operation (Figure 3A), which was introduced by Arnold Beckmann in the late 1930s. The analytical potentiometry has flourished ever since.

  Line Content: The art of making better and better ISEs has been subject of study of generations of researchers and some truly remarkable results have been achieved over the years. One particularly spectacular achievement has been the introduction of fluoride-selective ISE in 1966 (Frant). Its key functional element is single crystal of lanthanum fluoride, which is doped with europium ion. Fluoride <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ion</a> likes to partition into this crystal, in preference to all other ions, except one - hydroxyl ion and the europium ensures its mobility in the crystal. Hydroxyl ion which also likes to move inside lanthanum fluoride is an interferant. We speak of the affinity of these ions for the membrane. A simple way of eliminating hydroxide ion interference is by working at low <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p13"> pH</a> where the activity of OH<sup>-</sup> ions is low and negligible.

  Line Content: Another important trend in the development of potentiometric ion sensors has been miniaturization. It took place in the mid seventies and continues to date. It is illustrated in Figures 3B and 3C. We have seen that ISEs in general have high <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a> and therefore require high input <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i33"> impedance</a> amplifier for its operation. Invariably, that amplifier is a field-effect transistor (FET) in most modern pH meters. So, the idea arose to make the connection between the selective membrane and the amplifier input shorter and shorter (Figure 3B), leading to <u>solid contact ISEs</u>. Finally, the wire is eliminated entirely and the selective membrane has been placed directly at the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i24"> insulator</a> of the FET input gate. Thus a chemically selective field-effect transistor (CHEMFET) was born. The development of ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFET) paralleled, or rather borrowed from the ISEs. Obviously, protection of the FET part of the device from <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte solutions</a> presented challenge, but that too was relatively quickly overcome. With the significant reduction of size came also a hope of taking advantage of large scale combination of <u>electronics</u> and <u>chemical selectivity</u>. Unfortunately, it has not happened yet, due to mostly economic reasons. Soon other forms of CHEMFET appeared, enzymatically sensitive FET (ENFET) and work function gas FET WF-FET. At the level of this article there is no apparent connection between the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o18"> Ohms Law</a> and the Eisenmann-Nikolskii equation (<a href="#app">Appendix</a>). Nevertheless, such connection does exist and is very important for explanation of mechanism of selectivity of potentiometric sensors (Janata, 2009).

  Line Content: When the information is obtained from measurement of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a>, that is in amperometric sensors, the role of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o18"> Ohms Law</a> becomes immediately apparent. The <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> and its operation represents a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a>, which at a given constant <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e65"> potential</a> results in current. It is proportional to the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentration</a> of the species, which are being electrochemically transformed (that is, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduced or oxidized</a>) at the electrode. The <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r03"> redox process at the electrode</a> represent <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c02"> charge transfer</a> reactions that can proceed in either direction (oxidation or reduction) each with its own velocity. Those velocities relate to the value of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c67"> charge transfer resistance</a> of the redox reaction. Some electrochemical reactions proceed very fast in both directions and their charge transfer resistance is very low. We call such reactions reversible. On the other hand some reactions are very slow and their charge transfer resistance is very high. We call such electrode reactions irreversible. Thus, the relative speed of an electrochemical reaction can be related to its equivalent charge transfer resistance. This concept will become important when we discuss the principles of amperometric sensors, namely their selectivity.

It is flat because every molecule that reaches the surface of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> is immediately <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduced or oxidized</a>. The <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a> is therefore limited by the rate with which the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e83"> electroactive molecules</a> can be brought to the surface of the electrode. If we supply more electroactive molecules to the surface, for example, by stirring more vigorously or by increasing their <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentration</a> in the bulk, the current increases and vice versa. Under constant experimental conditions, the current is directly proportional to the concentration of the electroactive species in the bulk of the solution as long as the mass transport remains constant. So, although the relationship between the applied <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltage</a>, the resulting current and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a> of an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e01"> electrochemical cell</a> is governed by the same <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o18"> Ohms Law</a> as in any other electrical circuit, the non-linearity and the time variation of the resistance makes the electrochemical <u>equivalent electrical circuit</u> non-linear. That is both bad and good news. It would be ever so simple to treat the electrochemical cells as linear elements. On the other hand their non-linear behavior allows us to study them and learn more about the nature of the electrochemical processes involved. That is what most electrochemists do for living.
