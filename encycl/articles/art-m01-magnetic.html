                    The same principle applies when <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ions</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> electrons</a> are exposed in a liquid medium to combined electric and magnetic fields. Motion is generated, as shown in Figure 1, whose velocity is perpendicular to the direction of the generating fields. In a liquid solution with an astronomical number of ions "swimming" in a big pool of solvent (for example water), the outcome of the field interaction might appear to be chaotic and dissipated in randomness. Fortunately, this is not what happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Glancing again at Figure 1, imagine ions, forced by the magnetic and electric fields, sweeping by the solid plate. The sweeping motion generates considerable turbulence in the tiny liquid layer adjacent to the plate, called the interface. This interfacial turbulence is at the bottom of most, but not all, magnetic phenomena in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e10"> electrolysis</a>, that is when <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electric current</a> flows through an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte solution</a> in a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e01"> cell</a> held between the pole faces of a magnet.

                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all, magnets exert a strong influence on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e09"> electrode processes</a>. They can modify deposit structure, increase the rate of deposition of the reaction product(s), change flow patterns, and increase the intensity of mixing. Magnetoelectrochemistry is a fast growing new field of scientific and technical endeavor.

                <h3> Early observations</h3>


                Ironically, research in this field was started in a different direction by the distinguished scientist
                Michael Faraday (1791-1867) who could perhaps be called the Mozart of electromagnetism, on account of
                his talent and virtuosity. Early studies probed primarily magnetic influence on electrolyte properties
                (for example electric <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c48"> conductivity</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v11">
                    viscosity</a>, and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d19"> diffusivity</a>), and the magnitude of a very small
                induced <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e65"> potential</a> field, called the Hall effect. With continuing
                improvement of their precision over several decades, the Hall effect in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12">
                    electrolytes</a> was finally identified via impressive experimental techniques. The effect is many
                orders of magnitude smaller than in solid <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c50"> conductors</a> and gaseous
                plasmas, but the smallness of its magnitude is well compensated by the impetus it gave to the
                development of theoretical foundations of magnetoelectrochemical science. Similarly small, but highly
                reproducible local temperature variations (amounting to fractions of a degree) have been also
                demonstrated to exist in various electrolytes exposed to combined magnetic and electric fields by
                scientists at the University of Rheims, France (notably by Emmanuel Tronel-Peyroz and Alain Olivier).
                Not surprisingly, interest in these phenomena was at one time professed only by a small number of
                dedicated investigators. Magnetoelectrochemistry seemed to be confined to the realm of esoteric
                curiosity, exciting a few and leaving many indifferent. One scientist stated flatly in his book (written
                in the forties) on electrochemistry that the Hall effect did not exist at all in <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#a27"> aqueous</a> electrolytes! This young and fledgling science needed a
                strong push for survival.

                <br clear="left" />   <p>
                <h3> Coming of age</h3>

                The required strong push came from the alliance of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#c66"> convective</a> diffusion theory (CDT). MHD on its own offered a promising
                path to power generation, high precision pumping and flow metering, but electrochemistry was not
                included in its domain. CDT, on the other hand, established the importance of <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#m31"> mass transport</a> and fluid mechanics for modern electrochemistry.
                Combination of the two fields empowered researchers to design appropriate experimental scenarios to
                study magnetically induced phenomena on a scale much higher than previously. <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> Cathodic</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02"> deposition of metals</a>, flow
                propagation, and more recently oriented crystal growth are major avenues of demonstrating
                <em>tangible</em> magnitudes of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m54"> magnetic field</a> effect.
                Magnetoelectrochemistry has arrived at its mature stage.

                Pure metals may conveniently be <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02"> deposited</a> from <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte solutions</a> or molten electrolytes (in <a

                    electrowinning</a>). The process is especially inviting for precious metals (for example gold and
                silver) and copper, nickel, zinc, etc., although simultaneous <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h17"> hydrogen
                    evolution</a> in a number of cases may thwart deposit quality. The rate of deposition per unit
                substrate area, measured as <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c09"> current density</a>, is controlled by the <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#e66"> electrode potential</a>. The higher the potential, the higher the current
                density up to a certain point, beyond which the current cannot increase even if the potential is
                increased over a wide range. This is the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#l09"> limiting current density</a> for
                a given depositing species, and its magnitude depends on electrolyte properties and design features of
                the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e02"> electrolytic cell</a>. If <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19">
                    electrolysis</a> is carried out between the pole faces of a magnet, the limiting current density for
                a species increases in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field, upon proper matching of the <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#m54"> magnetic</a> and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e138"> electric fields</a>.
                The strength of the magnetic field may be expressed in terms of the magnetic flux density. A typical set
                of experimental observations during the magnetoelectrolytic deposition of copper indicates an
                essentially linear dependence of the maximum deposition rate on the magnetic flux density, but limiting
                current densities have been shown in the literature to vary with the power (exponent) of the magnetic
                flux density ranging from 0.25 to 1.64, depending on cell design, electrolyte composition and the metal
                species. See Table I.
                <p>

                    Apart from increased deposition rates, magnetic fields offer the bonus of providing evenness and
                    excellent adhesion of the metal deposits on their substrates, even at current densities where
                    deposit quality would be poor in their absence.

                A particularly interesting and potentially useful property of magnetic fields is the creation of
                preferential flow patterns or channels in liquid media. This phenomenon can easily be monitored by dyes
                used in analytical chemistry. The dyes change color due to a minute increase or decrease of hydrogen <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ions</a> in the solution at a conveniently chosen solid-liquid interface.
                The propagation of flow generated at the interface into the bulk solution is tagged by the dye (also
                called the indicator) whose color is much different (usually much darker) from the color of the dye in
                the unaffected zones of the liquid. The propagation pattern can easily be seen by the naked eye, and
                photographed by conventional means. Such observations demonstrate convincingly that MHD flow created by
                magnetic field imposition on flow cells with an electrified solid surface propagates via specific,
                preferential channels, and that significant portions of the liquid medium behave as "dead zones" for
                relatively long times. Flow generated at horizontal <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c50"> conducting</a>
                surfaces in parallel magnetic/electric fields propagates according to a snowballing sequence, which
                starts at a small local area on the surface, where the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electric
                    current</a> is slightly non-uniform at the onset. Current non-uniformity is an essential feature,
                because MHD theory predicts no magnetic field effect if the two fields are strictly parallel and
                uniform. A solid surface, however, is never absolutely uniform, and even microscopic-scale protuberances
                on the surface are capable of generating non-uniform currents. The interaction of these currents with
                magnetic fields gives rise to non-uniform flow, which becomes increasingly pronounced in time. This mode
                of flow propagation, which fluid mechanics experts call "anisotropic", may be useful to accelerate fluid
                transport in certain conduits.
                <p>
                    An example of this phenomenon is shown in Figure 2, showing the propagation of convective flow in
                    combined electric and magnetic fields. At the onset of the experiment (zero time) the transparent
                    analytical indicator changes its colour to dark blue due to a local shortage of hydrogen ions at the
                    upper electrified horizontal surface. Microscopic surface nonuniformity creates a small
                    conical-shaped flow pattern about twenty seconds later (a) Propagation remains confined to the
                    central zone of the cell, keeping its conical shape, which simultaneously expands downwards and
                    horizontally, while rotating around the vertical axis (b, about two minutes later). While rotation
                    continues, the funnel keeps expanding and begins to lose its conical shape (c, five minutes later).
                    At large times (d, ten minutes later) the flow tends to be chaotic, but the light-coloured areas
                    indicate the survival of dead zones. If the magnetic field were absent, a sluggish and uniform
                    downward movement of the tagged flow would indicate isotropic convection.

                Suppose you arrange an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e02"> electrolytic cell</a> such that when you drew a
                line in your mind connecting the edges of the magnetic pole faces, this imaginary line crosses the
                center of the cell. You will generate in this simple manner a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m54"> magnetic
                    field</a> gradient because at every point in the cell the magnitude of the magnetic flux density
                would be different. This gradient and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e138"> electric field</a> will create
                a strong turbulent motion in the liquid. If the gradient is large enough, the liquid surface will become
                wavy, and the liquid may even spill out of the cell. Rapid mixing in instances where mechanical
                agitation is impossible or undesirable is one practical application envisaged for this phenomenon. An
                example is shown in Figure 3. In this experimental cell a mixture of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a27">
                    aqueous</a> cupric sulfate and sulfuric <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a> was contained between
                two concentric cylindrical copper electrodes ("inner" cell) and between the outer cylindrical glass wall
                and one of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrodes</a> ("outer" cell). If the force generated by
                the interacting fields is large, the electrolyte surface in the inner cell, located in the nonuniform
                magnetic field, will undulate. The force may be made so strong that high amplitude waves will appear,
                and portions of the inner cell <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte</a> will spill into the outer
                cell. In the doctoral project of S. Mohanta (under the author's supervision) force magnitudes generated
                in initial "path-finding" experiments were sufficiently large to cause spilling from the outer cell onto
                the laboratory floor.

                Metal layers <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02"> deposited</a> from appropriate electrolytes in magnetic
                fields have attractive qualities of adhesion, smoothness, reflectiveness ("shininess"), but we do not

                growth is two-dimensional, in experiments conducted by I. Mogi, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku
                University, Japan. Without a magnetic field the growth is an uneven sprawl of fractal-like branches. If
                a magnetic field is imposed, the branches become increasingly regular and densely spaced as the strength
                of the field is increased. Eventually, an almost circular deposit is obtained. Similar observations have
                been made in the case of some other metals and polymers; the growth pattern is a fingerprint of
                substance, as well as the magnitude and direction of the magnetic flux density. With an eventually
                thorough understanding of these interactions, we will be able to "tailor-make" deposit structures with a
                desired degree of compactness, fractal dimensions, and shape.

                <h3> Where are we in 2008?</h3>

                It commonly happens in science and engineering that we have (at least tentative) theories to explain
                experimental phenomena, but only a modest amount of experimental data. In magnetoelectrochemistry the
                situation is reversed. No cogent or comprehensive theory exists at this time to explain the fast-growing
                body of observations under one big umbrella, although MHD, the theory of paramagnetism, the theory of <a
                    href="../../ed/dict.html#c66"> convective</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d19"> diffusion</a>, and certain
                other theories have been called upon to provide at least an approximate understanding of the
                experimental paradigm. There is a need for an all-encompassing theoretical framework, and it is hoped
                that it will catch up sooner or later with the laboratory, all the more so as experimental
                investigations continue to reach into new directions.
                <p>
                    Recognizing the need for some focusing of efforts, the May 20-23 workshop on Magnetism and
                    Electrochemistry held in Galway, Ireland in 2001 listed a number of unsolved problems due primarily
                    to (at least currently) limited understanding. Magnetic field effects on morphology; the origin of
                    magnetic anisotropy; anomalous codeposition phenomena; homogeneity of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02">
                        electrodeposited</a> alloys in small trenches (cavities); were earmarked as major items.
                    Three-dimensional mass transfer of magneto-electrochemical origin, turbulence and <a

                <p>
                    Magnetoelectrolysis has also been proved to provide an excellent means of producing thin metal
                    nanostructured films (for example, hexagonal phase cobalt with a strong preferred &lt;100&gt;
                    orientation, where the magnetic field of flux densities, up to 15 tesla, is antiparallel to the
                    motion of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ions</a>). There is a generally strong interest in
                    microscopic and rotational phenomena, local convection, and magneto-convection. Quantification of
                    magnetic force microscopy images, electromagnetic microstructuring, applying magnetic micro-fluid
                    chips to reacting media, and the study of chirality (three-dimensional stereoisomerism exhibited
                    by <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m34"> molecules</a> that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image)
                    are just a few important indicators of the rapidly expanding scope of research.

                <h3> Can a unified theory of magneto-electrochemistry be expected to emerge eventually?</h3>
                <p>

                    Not unlike modern physics, saddled with the problem of dovetailing cosmological-scale and subatomic
                    observations into a single framework, the science of magneto-electrochemical phenomena is also faced
                    by the conundrum of scale. On a very small scale, for instance, paramagnetism of ions moving in a
                    combined electric-magnetic field plays an important, if not predominant, role. Large-scale MHD
                    forces, on the other hand, relegate paramagnetism at best to a secondary position. The final
                    emergence of a unifying theory remains questionable at this time. See however a discussion in the <a

                    where "σ" is the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c48"> electrical conductivity</a> of the liquid medium.
                    Consider a simple field configuration, where both magnetic and electric fields are unidimensional
                    and mutually perpendicular, for example <strong>E</strong> = <strong>
                        u</strong><sub>y</sub>E<sub>y</sub> and <strong>B</strong> =

                    observed in the absence of the magnetic field, and (b) the appearance of current density component
                    "j<sub>x</sub>" in the third Cartesian direction. The resulting two-dimensional motion in the (x, y)
                    plane is particularly pronounced in the vicinity of the solid-liquid interface, where important
                    magnitudes of "v<sub>x</sub>" and "v<sub>y</sub>" may already exist due to other force fields, such
                    as buoyancy inside a natural convective boundary layer. The magnetic field magnifies this effect and
                    generates locally large turbulence. A thorough analysis of this phenomenon requires a much more
                    involved mathematical apparatus than the MHD Ohm's law (see for example, <u> Hydrodynamic Models in
                        Magnetoelectrolysis,</u> T. Z. Fahidy, Electrochimica Acta, Vol.18, pp 607-614, 1973).

                    The final emergence of a unifying theory remains questionable at this time. We may envisage,
                    nevertheless, that various mathematical and phenomenological approaches could successfully explore
                    new horizons. One such avenue might be offered by bifurcation and catastrophe theory, well
                    established in the study of modern system dynamics. The key feature here is that a very small change
                    in (physical) parameters can lead to entirely different structures. Beltrami (1998, Example 7.1, p
                    154) demonstrates the simple bifurcation occurring at <i>a = 0</i> (called a fold catastrophe) for
                    the function <i>y(x, a) = x<sup>3</sup>/3  ax</i>. When the parameter <i>a</i> is negative, <i>y(x,
                        a)</i> is a monotone increasing, or a monotone decreasing function. When <i>a = 0</i>, we have
                    the simple cubic equation <i>y = x<sup>3</sup></i>, still a monotone increasing or a monotone
                    decreasing function. When <i>a</i> is positive, monotonic behavior no longer exists: there are two
                    local extrema at locations <i>x = -a</i> and <i>x = a</i>, whose values: <i>2a<sup>3/2</sup>/3</i>
                    and <i>-2a<sup>3/2</sup>/3</i> are symmetrical with respect to the origin. Bifurcations caused by
                    very small changes in physical parameters, for example, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c48">
                        conductivity</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d19"> diffusivity</a> of an <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte</a>, at certain locations (for example, in the <a
                        href="../../ed/dict.html#h16"> boundary layer</a>) may arguably yield different solutions to the
                    governing dynamic equations. In this manner, specific vortex motions, convective propagation
                    patterns, etc. may be predictable, at least in a semi-quantitative sense. Magneto-electrochemical
                    systems might, in fact, possess a plethora of bifurcations, waiting to be discovered.
