<h3> Historical introduction </h3>
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#e52"> Electrochemical capacitors</a> provide a mode of electrical <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge-</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e72"> energy-storage</a> and delivery, complementary to that by <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r01"> batteries</a>. The first electrochemical capacitor device was disclosed in a General Electric Co. patent in 1957 to Becker but was of a crude nature, employing porous <a href="art-c01-carbon.htm"><em> carbon</em></a>. Later work by Sohio (1969) described a so-called "electrokinetic capacitor" utilizing porous carbon in a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#n18"> non-aqueous</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte</a> which enabled it to be <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c12"> charged</a> up to about 3 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#v09"> V</a>, though the operation of the device was not "<a href="../ed/dict.htm#e80">electrokinetic</a>" in nature, a misnomer. In 1971, Trasatti and Buzzanca recognized that the electrochemical charging behavior of ruthenium dioxide films was like that of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c05"> capacitors</a>. Between 1975 and 1980, the present author and his co-workers, under contract with the then Continental Group Inc., carried out extensive fundamental and development work on the ruthenium oxide type of electrochemical capacitor (Conway, 1997) which behaves as a surface-<a href="../ed/dict.htm#r19"> redox</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p58"> pseudocapacitance</a> (see <a href="#pscac"> below</a>). The whole field has burgeoned since about 1990 and is very active in fundamental, and R&amp;D directions.
<p>
A great deal of scientific and technological research has been reported in the scientific literature since about 1990. An extensive and detailed account of this has been given in the author's monograph on "Electrochemical Supercapacitors: Scientific Fundamentals and Technological Applications" (1999).
<p>
<h3> Scientific introduction </h3>

In order to describe "electrochemical capacitors" and to explain their function and applications, it is necessary first to consider the nature of an ordinary electrostatic capacitor or a "condenser" as it used to be called, and thence the meaning of the term electrical <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c62"> capacitance</a>.
<p>
The nature of electricity took a long time to be understood, from the early experiments on electrostatic electricity in the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century, for example by Galvani, through the time of the invention of the first electric battery by <a href="art-v01-volta.htm"><em> Alessandro Volta (Volta's "Pile")</em></a> in 1800, on to Faradays's and Davy's monumental discoveries on the chemical origin of electricity generated by Volta's pile. At first, two "kinds" of electricity were postulated: "animal electricity", as in the works of Galvani on stimulation of the frog's leg nerve by contact between two dissimilar metals and later, "Voltaic electricity" generated chemically from a Volta pile of zinc and silver or copper plates separated by paper wetted with an <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a18">acid</a> or salt solution (Conway, 2000).
<p>
In parallel with these discoveries were extensive works on electrostatic electricity generated for example by the rubbing of naturally occurring amber or by the so-called Wimshurst machine (a rotating circular plate, containing insets of amber-like material, rubbing against charge-collector plates connected overall to a Leyden Jar or a spark-gap). It was from this direction of research on electricity that the invention of the electric condenser arose, referred to as the "Leyden Jar", and capable of storing <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> electric charge</a> generated by a Wimshurst machine. Such a jar had the "capacity", depending on its dimensions and materials of construction, of storing electric charge by bringing it together in a condensed way (hence the term "condenser") on the surfaces of a Leyden Jar at a certain two-dimensional <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c41"> charge density</a>.
<p>
<a name="leyden"></a>The principle of design and operation of the Leyden Jar and all subsequent regular condensers or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c05"> capacitor</a> devices, is as follows. Two metal surfaces that constitute electrodes are separated at some small distance either in air (or vacuum) or on each side of a liquid or solid film, referred to as the "<a href="art-d01-dielectrics.htm"><em>dielectric</em></a>", a term first used by Michael Faraday . For a given separation of the electrode plates, the capacitance developed per unit area of the two plates depends on the properties of the dielectric between the plates characterized by its so-called <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d50"> dielectric constant</a>.

In the case of the Leyden Jar (Figure 1), the material (glass) of the jar itself serves a the dielectric medium and the contact plates were metal foils wrapped, inside and out, around the cylindrical surfaces of the jar. The electrical contact to the inner surface foil was by means of a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c50"> conducting</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte solution</a> (or originally by ordinary water itself) in which was immersed a conducting metal <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a> for electrical contact. The device was charged by joining two wires from the inside electrode and the outside foil to an electrostatic machine of the Wimshurst type. In later experimentation, the Leyden Jar capacitor was connected to the electrodes of a <a href="art-v01-volta.htm"><em> Volta's pile</em></a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#b01"> battery</a> for <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c12"> charging</a>. This was the first-generation capacitor for <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e72"> storage</a> of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> electric charge</a>.
<p>
The nature of electric charge remained elusive until much later (1897) when J.J. Thomson identified and characterized the fundamental entity of electric charge as the "<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33">electron</a>", present ubiquitously in all <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33"> atoms</a> of the Universe and identified, in his experiments, by means of experiments on gases at low pressures in gas-discharge tubes (Crookes tubes or neon lights). The electron charge was determined independently by Townsend and by Millikan (Glasstone, 1940), and was shown to be equivalent to <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f13"> Faraday's constant</a> for the relation between extent of passage of charge and extent of chemical change (as related by <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f12"> Faraday's Laws</a>) caused by <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e19"> electrolysis</a> of conducting solutions, when calculated on a "per <a href="../ed/dict.htm#g11"> gram-atom</a>" or "<a href="../ed/dict.htm#g10">gram-equivalent</a>" basis.

<br clear="left">   <p>
<h3> Relation of capacitance to geometry and dielectric constant of a capacitor</h3>

The capacitance of a capacitor is proportional to the area of the contact plates and the dielectric constant of the medium between the plates, and it is inversely proportional to the separation between the plates (see the <a href="#app1"> Appendix</a>). In relation to electrochemical capacitors, to be discussed below, the capacitance of small <a href="art-d01-dielectrics.htm"><em> dielectric</em></a> capacitors is very small being on the order of microfarads or nanofarads (millionth or billionth of a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f08">farad</a>, respectively) for small devices on the order of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m64"> mm</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c109"> cm</a> in dimensions. By having very thin <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i24"> insulating</a> films, on the order of 10 to 100 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#n26"> nanometers</a>, formed <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a02"> anodically</a> on the plate of a two-electrode capacitor, substantially larger specific capacitances (that is per /<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a>) can be attained. Such devices are called "<a href="art-c04-electr-cap.htm"><em>electrolytic capacitors</em></a>" because the thin dielectric oxide films are formed on the plates by an <a href="art-a02-anodizing.htm"><em> anodic electrolysis</em></a> procedure applied at metals such as aluminum, tantalum, titanium, niobium, etc. Such capacitors are still of the dielectric type (the dielectric medium being here the thin, insulating oxide film, usually having a relatively high dielectric constant) and should not be confused with the "electrochemical" capacitor type of device which is the topic of this article.
<p>
Electrochemical capacitors are a special kind of capacitor based on <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c12"> charging</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> discharging</a> the interfaces of high specific-area materials such as porous <a href="art-c01-carbon.htm"><em> carbon</em></a> materials or porous oxides of some metals. They can store electric charge and corresponding <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e51"> energy at high densities</a> in an highly reversible way, as does a regular <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c05"> capacitor</a>, and hence can be operated at specific <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p20"> power densities</a> (in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#w04"> watts</a>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#k16">kg</a>) substantially higher than can most <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r01"> batteries</a>. Their capacitance for a given size of the device is thus much higher, by a factor of 10,000 or so, than those achievable with regular capacitors. For this reason proprietary names such as "Supercapacitors" or "Ultracapacitors" have been coined to describe their performance.
<p>
While they function formally like rechargeable batteries in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e72"> storing</a> or delivering <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> electric charge</a>, their mechanisms of charge storage are quite different, in most cases, from those operating in batteries. Thus, electrochemical capacitors are not substitutes for batteries but rather are to be regarded as <em> complementary</em> to them for charge storage or delivery. They can offer advantageously fast charging or discharging rates over most batteries of comparable volume but their energy density is usually less, by a factor of 3 to 4, than that of batteries. Their high power or power densities, however, enables them to be employed in interesting complementary ways in hybrid systems with batteries.
<p>
An important difference between charging a capacitor and charging a battery is that there is always an <em> intrinsic</em> increase of voltage on charge (or decrease on discharge) of a capacitor as the charge per <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122"> cm<sup>2</sup></a> is increased or decreased. In contrast, an ideal battery has a constant <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c19"> voltage</a> during discharge or recharge except as the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s41"> state of charge</a> approaches 0 or 100%. Although practical batteries exhibit <em> some</em> dependence of cell voltage on state of charge, especially <a href="../ed/dict.htm#l18"> lithium-intercalation batteries</a>, the latter for fundamental reasons arising from intercalation. (See the <a href="#app2"> Appendix</a> for further details.)

An important class of electrochemical capacitors utilizes the co-called <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e30"> double-layer</a> capacitance that arises at all <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a> interfaces with <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte solutions</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i37"> ionic melts</a>. The concept and model of the double layer arose in the work of von Helmholtz (1853) on the interfaces of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c116"> colloidal suspensions</a> and was subsequently extended to surfaces of metal electrodes by Gouy, Chapman, and Stern, and later in the notable work of Grahame around 1947. Models of the double layer are shown in Figure 2, with their capacitor-like structures.
<p>
Helmholtz envisaged a capacitor-like separation of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a04"> anionic</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c07"> cationic</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charges</a> across the interface of colloidal particles with an electrolyte. For electrode interfaces with an electrolyte solution, this concept was extended to model the separation of "<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33">electronic</a>" charges residing at the metal <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a> surfaces (manifested as an excess of negative <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c41"> charge densities</a> under negative <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p06"> polarization</a> with respect to the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte solution</a> or as a deficiency of electron charge density under positive polarization), depending in each case, on the corresponding <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e65"> potential</a> difference between the electrode and the solution boundary at the electrode. For zero net charge, the corresponding potential is referred to as the "<a href="../ed/dict.htm#p16">potential of zero charge</a>".
<p>
In response to positive or negative electric polarization of the electrode relative accumulations of cations or anions develop, respectively, at the solution side of the charged electrode. If, for energetic reasons, the ions of the electrolyte are not <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f04"> faradaically</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> dischargeable</a> (that is no <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c02"> electron transfer</a> can occur across the interface ("<a href="../ed/dict.htm#i11">ideally polarizable electrode</a>", for example a mercury electrode, Grahame 1947 and Parsons 1954), then an electrostatic electrical <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e29"> equilibrium</a> is established at the interface resulting in a "double layer" of separated charges (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33">electrons</a> or electron deficiency at the metal side and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c07"> cations</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a04"> anions</a> at the solution side of the interface boundary), negative and positive, across the interface.
<p>
The difference of potential extends beyond the immediate layer of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s24"> solvated</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a> in the compact, capacitor-like (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#h08">Helmholtz</a>) region, out into solution, so that a further <a href="../ed/dict.htm#g12"> diffuse region capacitance</a> (the diffuse-layer capacitance "C<sub>diff</sub>") arises. It combines with that of Helmholtz's region "C<sub>H</sub>" in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s21"> series</a>. (See the <a href="#app3"> Appendix</a> for further details.)

<br clear="left"/>   <p>

The Helmholtz region capacitance "C<sub>H</sub>" is of special significance for electrochemical capacitors since it is directly dependent on accessible <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a> area and has large values (relative to those for regular <a href="art-d01-dielectrics.htm"><em> dielectric</em></a> capacitors) between about 16 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m45"> µF</a>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a> and about 40-50 µF/cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e66"> electrode potential</a>, the chemical nature of the metal surface, chemical nature of the solvent, and the types of ions (and their solvation by the solvent) present in the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte solution</a>.
<p>
The most extensively studied metal surface, with respect to its double-layer capacitance, is that of mercury in various solvent media, especially water.
<p>
It was mentioned that the specific capacitances of electrode double layers are very large, some 10,000 times those of ordinary dielectric capacitors, per /<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a> area. The reason for this is that the separation of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charges</a> in electrochemical double layers is on the order of 0.3-0.5 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#n27"> nm</a> instead of 10 to 100 nm with oxide-film <a href="art-d01-dielectrics.htm"><em> dielectrics</em></a> (<a href="art-c04-electr-cap.htm"><em>electrolytic capacitors</em></a>) or 1000 nm with very thin mica or polystyrene dielectric-film hardware capacitors.
<p>
Hence, it is seen that with large specific-area porous electrodes, for example at <a href="art-c01-carbon.htm"><em> carbons</em></a> having say 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#g19">g</a> of material and exhibiting, say, 15 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m45"> µF</a>/(real <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122"> cm<sup>2</sup></a> of double-layer capacitance in some suitable electrolyte solution, the accessible capacitance "C" is 1000 (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#m90">m<sup>2</sup></a>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#g19">g</a>) Ã— 10,000 (cm<sup>2</sup>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#m90">m<sup>2</sup></a>) Ã— 15 (µF/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a>) = 150 million µF/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#g19">g</a>, that is 150 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f08"> farads</a>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#g19">g</a>, a <em> very large capacitance!</em> Hence the term "supercapacitors" or "ultracapacitors" for devices based on double-layer capacitance at high-area substrates.
<p>
The high degree of reversibility of charge acceptance and delivery, and hence capability for excellent operating <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e70"> power</a> levels compared with <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r01"> batteries</a> of comparable size arises because no slow chemical processes or phase changes take place between <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c12"> charge</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> discharge</a> as they do in most battery-type electrical charge generating devices.
<p>
It is the essence of battery-type charge/discharge processes that <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f05"> faradaic processes</a> take place leading to major chemical and structural changes of the electrochemical reactive materials, for example conversions of lead dioxide to lead sulfate and lead metal to lead sulfate in discharge of the lead-acid battery which, as is well known, limits charge/discharge to a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c11"> cycle life</a> of 1000 to 3000, depending on rates of charge and discharge, and temperature. By contrast, electrochemical double-layer and oxide-type (see <a href="#pscac"> below</a>) capacitors can exhibit cycle lives up to one million under suitable conditions. This is because, ideally at least, only storage and delivery of electrostatic charge takes place at the extended two-dimensional interface of high-area materials and no irreversible or slow chemical phase changes take place as they do between three-dimensional chemical materials in rechargeable batteries. This is a fundamental difference between the electrochemical behavior and properties of electrochemical capacitors relative to those of batteries.
<p>
<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Electrical irreversibility in electrochemical capacitor charging and discharge: rate effects </em></h3> 

It was stated earlier in this article that charging and discharging of electrochemical capacitors has commonly been perceived as a process much more reversible than that for batteries and hence being capable of operation at high <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p20"> power densities</a>. While, in practice, this is largely true, charging of the high-area, porous-electrode structures that are required for achieving large <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c62"> capacitance</a> densities (farads/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#g19">g</a> or farads/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c121">cm<sup>3</sup></a>) encounters limitations of rate due to the distributed electrolytic and contact <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r23"> resistances</a> within the pore structure of such materials.

In the simplest analysis, any practical capacitor device behaves as if an <a href="../ed/dict.htm#o19"> ohmic resistance</a> is in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s21"> series</a> with it, the so-called equivalent (or real) series resistance (Figure 3).
<p>
The presence of real or equivalent series resistance in the operating equivalent circuit of any capacitor introduces an <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i13"> ir potential drop</a> in the process of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c12"> charging</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> discharging</a> and this drop depends, of course, on the charging rate (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c14">current</a>) leading to distortion of the charging curve of accumulated <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge</a> against <a href="../ed/dict.htm#v08"> voltage</a>, in time. When the distributed resistance effect also operates, as it normally does, the distortion effect becomes more complex but has been experimentally and computationally evaluated (de Levie, 1963).
<p>
The above effect causes limitation of rates at which the capacitor can be charged or discharged and, for <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a41"> ac</a> modulated charging, it also introduces a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f23"> frequency</a>-dependent phase angle (normally -90<sup>o</sup>) between the modulated applied voltage and the resultant charging current. This also applies to other, non-constant charging modes.

In practice, with a porous electrode, the situation is much more complex since the matrix of microscopic pores within the macroscopic electrode structure offers a complex, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s21"> series</a>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#p18">parallel</a> equivalent circuit comprised of a distribution of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#o19"> ohmic</a> (resistive) and capacitive elements which leads to the whole electrode having a non-uniform effective resistance and capacitance, dependent on frequency (in ac modulation) or on the time-scale of pulsed or non-constant rates of charging. As shown in the classical work of de Levie (1963), the equivalent circuit for such electrodes is that of a transmission line (Figure 4) having a -45<sup>o</sup> phase angle (Figure 5) characterizing its <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i33"> impedance</a> behavior.

This situation leads to limitation of the rates of which <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c12"> charging</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> discharging</a> of porous capacitor electrodes can be conducted and is additional to any equivalent series resistance effects a practical cell may experience due to cell design and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r23"> resistance</a>.
<p>
de Levie has pointed out that the distributed R/C effect in porous electrodes is equivalent to restrictions of power due to <a href="../ed/dict.htm#o09"> ohmic ir drop</a> (that is the potential drop due to current passing through resistive elements in the matrix). Thus there is a "penetration effect" into the electrode matrix due to attenuation of for example a modulation or time-dependent transient charging voltage so that not all of the depth or width, or diameter of the electrode structure is subject to a uniform charging rate. This introduces a non-chemical irreversibility in the charge/discharge behavior of the electrochemical capacitor device which is electrically demonstrable.
<p>
It must be stated, however, that in state-of-the-art developments of electrochemical capacitors, using <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a27"> aqueous-solution</a> electrolytes, the above distributed-resistance effect has been substantially minimized so that devices having high operating power have been successfully engineered and marketed. Nevertheless, with non-aqueous electrolyte capacitors, which have higher operating voltages up to 3.0 to 3.5 V (hence 9 to 12 times energy density which depends on the <em> square</em> of maximum operating voltage), the distributed <a href="../ed/dict.htm#o19"> ohmic effects</a> are more significant so that achievable operating power levels are less than those attainable with aqueous electrolyte devices.

<a name="pscac"> <h3> Electrochemical capacitors based on pseudocapacitance </h3></a>

A different kind of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c62"> capacitance</a> can arise at <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrodes</a> of certain kinds, for example ruthenium dioxide, when the extent of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f05"> faradaically</a> admitted <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge</a> depends linearly, or approximately linearly, on the applied <a href="../ed/dict.htm#v08"> voltage</a>. For such a situation, the electrode behavior is equivalent to, and measurable as, a capacitance. This capacitance can be large but it is <em> faradaic</em> and not electrostatic (that is non-faradaic) in origin. This is hence an important difference from the nature of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d15"> double-layer capacitance</a>, so it is called "pseudocapacitance". This kind of pseudocapacitance can originate when an electrochemical <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c02"> charge-transfer process</a> takes place to an extent limited by a finite quantity of reagent or of available surface. Several examples of pseudocapacitance can arise, but the capacitance function is usually not constant and, in fact, is usually appreciably dependent on <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e66"> potential</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s41"> state of charge</a>.
<p>
However, when the process is surface limited, and is proceeding in several one-<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33">electron</a> stages, a broad range of significant capacitance values arises as is found with ruthenium dioxide electrodes where the pseudocapacitance is almost constant (within 5%) over the full operating voltage range. Some other metal oxides behave similarly but only over smaller operating voltage ranges. The ruthenium dioxide pseudocapacitance provides one of the best examples of electrochemical (pseudo)capacitance as, in addition to the almost constant capacitance over a wide voltage range, its reversibility is excellent, with a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c11"> cycle life</a> over several hundred-thousand cycles. Furthermore, the pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance of an electrochemical capacitor by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer capacitance. However, its cost prevents its large-scale use so that it has been employed mainly in military applications.
<p>
Another type of material exhibiting pseudocapacitive behavior that is highly reversible is the family of <a href="art-c05-condpol.htm"><em> conducting polymers</em></a> such as polyaniline or derivatives of polythiophene. These are cheaper than ruthenium dioxide but are less stable, giving only thousands of cycles (still quite attractive) over a wide voltage range. (See the <a href="#app4"> Appendix</a> for a more detailed discussion of the pseudocapacitance.)
<p>
<h3> Applications and technology </h3>
<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> 
Fabrication of electrochemical capacitors </em></h3> 

General industrial production of electrochemical capacitors follows that of battery cell procedures with automatic production-line machinery. Cell designs are of various kinds including cylindrical, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p60"> prismatic</a>, button, or coin types, with some larger embodiments being of cake-tin sizes or larger, and some multi-cell series for higher voltage with <a href="../ed/dict.htm#b03"> bipolar</a> electrodes having edge seals. In <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s21"> series</a> configurations for high-voltage applications, balancing of unit cell performance and behavior is a technological challenge.

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Hybrid systems </em></h3> 

The high <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p20"> power-density</a> capability of electrochemical capacitors has led them to be employed in hybrid configurations with <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r01"> batteries</a> and <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.htm"><em> fuel cells</em></a> in a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#l13"> load-leveling</a> function, for example in electric vehicles. The capacitor component, suitably coupled with a battery or fuel cell, provides the necessary power density for up-hill or accelerative driving while <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r45"> regenerative braking</a> provides a certain extent of recharging.
<p>
Another type of hybrid system is where ruthenium dioxide is used as a second oxide component, acting as a pseudocapacitance in <a href="art-c04-electr-cap.htm"><em> electrolytic capacitors</em></a> (the Evans Hybrid Capacitor). This gives indirectly, an improved capacitance density for the overall two-electrode device.
<p>
Another interesting hybrid type, currently under investigation in our own and other laboratories, is a combination of a double-layer <a href="art-c01-carbon.htm"><em> carbon</em></a> (electrochemical capacitor) electrode combined to work against a rechargeable battery <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a>, for example a lead-acid positive <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p03"> plate</a> (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a18">acidic</a> solution) or a nickel battery positive plate (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#a19">alkaline</a> solution). This type of device (called an asymmetric capacitor) enables almost all of the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge</a> residing on the capacitor-type electrode to be utilized on <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> discharge</a> in contrast to the battery-type electrode while, with a symmetrical capacitor made with two similar <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d15"> double-layer capacitance</a> electrodes, each electrode is only half discharged from its initial voltage, relative to the other electrode, when the cell discharge voltage reaches zero, therefore delivering less electrical energy than the hybrid.
<p>
Another application is in electrical research experiments where very high <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e69"> energy</a> and high-rate discharges are required, for example through gases for high-energy spark or arc generation.
<p>
A variety of other applications has been envisaged in the literature (Conway, 1999). Examples are: cold-start assist for diesel locomotives; emergency back-up power for computer systems; stationary power-system <a href="../ed/dict.htm#l13"> load leveling</a> or bridging for short-period power outages; energy source for initial heating of catalytic converter units; energy collection and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e72"> storage</a> from windmill dynamos.
<p>
For society at large, the use of capacitor/battery hybrid systems for improvement of electric-vehicle (EV) performance will assist the adoption of EV transportation systems with zero or diminished nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide atmospheric contamination. However, such a transition to an "EV lifestyle" will probably not become substantial for another one to two decades.

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Relation of capacitance to geometry and dielectric constant of a capacitor </em></h3> 

The <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c62"> capacitance</a> "C" of a capacitor depends on a) the area "A" of the contact plates, b) the separation "d" between the plates (when parallel), and c) the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d50"> dielectric constant</a> "Îµ" of the medium between the plates (limitingly vacuum, for which "Îµ" is taken as 1; for all other materials, including gases, Îµ &gt; 1). The relationship between "C" and the above quantities is given by the simple equation (Conway 1999)
<p>
[1] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> C = A Îµ / 4 Ï d  
<p>
or, in terms of so-called rationalized units,
<p>
[2] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> C = AÎµ Îµ<sub>o</sub> / d
<p>
where Îµ<sub>o</sub> (= 8.84 Ã— 10<sup>-12</sup> farads/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#m22">m</a>) is the dielectric permittivity of free space. The units of "C" are in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f08"> farads</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c40"> coulombs</a> per <a href="../ed/dict.htm#v07"> volt</a>, that is coulombs stored by the capacitor per volt across its two electrodes.
<p>
<a name="app2"> <h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Some important differences between capacitors and batteries </em></h3></a>

An important difference between <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c12"> charging</a> a capacitor and charging a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r01"> battery</a> is that there is always an <em> intrinsic</em> increase of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#v08"> voltage</a> "V" on charge (or decrease on <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> discharge</a>) of a capacitor as the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge</a> per <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122"> cm<sup>2</sup></a> is increased or decreased, according to Equation [3] which defines the relation between capacitance "C" and the inter-plate voltage "V" that arises from accumulation of a charge "q":
<p>
[3] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> C = q/V or q = CV
<p>
In contrast, an ideal battery has a constant voltage during discharge or recharge except as the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s41"> state of charge</a> approaches 0 or 100%. (Practically, most batteries exhibit some dependence of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c19"> cell voltage</a> on state of charge, especially <a href="../ed/dict.htm#l18"> lithium-intercalation batteries</a>, the latter for fundamental reasons arising from intercalation).
<p>
The consequence of the above difference, based on Equation [3], is that the energy stored by a capacitor is 1/2 CV<sup>2</sup> or 1/2 qV while, for a battery, the corresponding stored <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e69"> energy</a> (or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e51"> energy density</a>) is qÎ”V, twice as much as that for a capacitor charged to the same cell voltage "Î”V". Thus, the stored energy in a capacitor device increases as the <em> square</em> of the cell voltage "V" as charge is accumulated. This is an important difference between capacitor and battery cell behavior and affects the interfacing between such systems in hybrid devices.
<p>
It was noted above that the energy stored in a capacitor cell, charged to a voltage "V" is 1/2 CV<sup>2</sup> and "V" increases as charge "q" accumulates on its plates determined by "C". The charging energy 1/2 CV<sup>2</sup> arises in the following way. For a capacitor being charged from an initial voltage V = 0 to a final value "V<sub>f</sub>" the energy "E" stored will be a free-energy "G" (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135">charge</a> times voltage):
<p>
[4] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> <img src="fig/c03/c03-eq-04.gif"/>

At any state of charge, q = CV (Equation [3]), so that

The <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c41"> charge density</a> "q" (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c40">coulomb</a>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a>) of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33"> electrons</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a> at the interface is dependent on the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e65"> potential</a> difference, Î”Î¦, across this double layer so that a differential capacitance "C<sub>dl</sub>" arises determined by

<a name="app4"> <h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Pseudocapacitance</em></h3></a>

A different kind of capacitance can arise at electrodes of certain kinds, for example ruthenium dioxide, when the extent of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#f05"> faradaically</a> admitted <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e135"> charge</a> "q" depends linearly, or approximately linearly, on the applied voltage "V". For such a situation, there is a mathematical derivative, dq/dV that would be constant, which is equivalent to, and measurable as, a capacitance (see Equation [3]). This capacitance, denoted by "C<sub>Î¦</sub>", can be large but it is <em> faradaic</em> and not electrostatic (that is non-faradaic) in origin. This is hence an important difference from the nature of double-layer capacitance "C" or "C<sub>dl</sub>" so it is called "pseudocapacitance". The pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance of an electrochemical capacitor by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer capacitance.
<p>
This kind of pseudocapacitance can originate when an electrochemical <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c02"> charge-transfer process</a> takes place to an extent limited by a finite quantity of reagent or of available surface, the latter in the case of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorption</a> (for example of hydrogen), with charge transfer. Several examples of pseudocapacitance can arise as follows, but the "C<sub>Î¦</sub>" function is usually not constant and, in fact, is usually appreciably dependent on <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e66"> potential</a> or <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s41"> state of charge</a>.
<p>
a) When an electrochemical adsorption process, arising from charge transfer, takes place at an electrode surface, for example in the process of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e94"> electrosorption</a> of H <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33"> atoms</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d10"> discharged</a> at Pt <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a> surfaces in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a27"> aqueous</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a18"> acid</a> solution by the process:
<p>
[9] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + Pt + e<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; H<sub>2</sub>O + Pt/H
<p>
so-called <a href="../ed/dict.htm#u07"> underpotential deposition</a> since the above reaction takes place over a potential range "Î”V" of about 0.35 V positive to the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e29"> equilibrium potential</a> for <a href="../ed/dict.htm#h17"> H<sub>2</sub> gas evolution</a> in the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#w01"> electrolysis of water</a>.
<p>
Fractional H coverages "Î˜" at Pt can increase continuously, over the above electrode potential range, from 0 to 1, prior to evolution of H<sub>2</sub> and each <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33"> atom</a> of H deposited requires passage of one <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a33"> electron</a> of electric charge. Hence, a pseudocapacitance "C<sub>Î¦</sub>" arises from the relation between charge passed "q" and "Î”V", and "q" is faradaically related to the coverage fraction "Î˜" of electrodeposited H. A full monolayer (Î˜ ==&gt; 1) of H requires passage of about 210 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m49"> µC</a> of charge "q<sub>1</sub>" per <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122"> cm<sup>2</sup></a> of a smooth Pt surface.
<p>
[10] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/>   C<sub>Î¦</sub> = q<sub>1</sub> dÎ˜/dÎ”V
<p>
"Î˜" is related to electrode potential "V" by the relation 
<p>
[11] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/>Î˜/(1 - Î˜) = K <em> exp</em> (VF/RT)
<p>
b) A number of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e16"> electrochemical reactions</a> involving species in solution, such as Fe<sup>+++</sup>/Fe<sup>++</sup> or [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>/[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup>, known as <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r03"> redox processes</a>, take place at <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i34"> inert electrodes</a>, for example Au or Pt, with a logarithmic relation (the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#n02"> Nernst equation</a>) between the extents of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation/reduction</a> between the redox couple pair of ions. Thus, for example
<p>
[12] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> E = E<sup>o</sup> + (RT/F) <em> ln</em> a[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup>/a[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup>
<p>
where "a" represents the respective <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a10"> activities</a> of the two ions of the redox couple. The above Equation [11] can be rearranged in terms of the fractions of a given chemical quantity of the redox ions in the reversible reaction
<p>
[13] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> &lt;==&gt;  [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup>
<p>
that exist in the course of reduction (or reoxidation) as a function of the potential "E" in relation to its so-called <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s13"> standard value</a> "E<sup>o</sup>" in Equation [12]. E = E<sup>o</sup> when the reagent ion activities (<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26">concentrations</a>) are equal so that the <em> ln</em> function is zero. The rearranged form of Equation [11] is in terms of the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m06"> molar quantities</a> "Q<sub>ox</sub>" and "Q<sub>red</sub>" in relation to the total reagents Q<sub>ox</sub> + Q<sub>red</sub> (= Q) and reads
<p>
[14] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> <img src="fig/c03/c03-eq-14.gif"/>
<p>
with Q<sub>red</sub>/Q = 1 - Q<sub>ox</sub>/Q. Then it is seen that Equation [14] has the <em> same</em> form as that of Equation [11] (after taking logarithms) for <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e94"> electrosorption</a> and its derivative is a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c62"> capacitance</a> quantity.
<p>
c) A similar logarithmic relation in X / (1 - X) applies to <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a32"> absorption</a> of Li<sup>+</sup> ions into Li-intercalation hosts in Li-ion battery electrochemistry where "X" is the fractional occupancy of available intercalation sites in the intercalation host material, for example TiS<sub>2</sub>, CoO<sub>2</sub>, etc. Hence, Li<sup>+</sup> ion intercalation formally exhibits a pseudocapacitance, though the Li<sup>+</sup> ion systems are normally referred to as battery devices.

In each of the three types of pseudocapacitance systems, "C<sub>Î¦</sub>" is substantially dependent on potential, having a large maximum of about 2200 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m45"> µF</a>/<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a> at "Î˜", "Q<sub>ox</sub>/Q", or "X" equal to 0.5, but with appreciable values of "C<sub>Î¦</sub>" arising only over a potential range of about 120 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m16"> mV</a> which is too narrow to be of value for practical applications.
<p>
However, when the redox process is a surface one, proceeding in several one electron stages, a much broader range (1.4 <a href="../ed/dict.htm#v09"> V</a>) of significant "C<sub>Î¦</sub>" values arises as is found with RuO<sub>2</sub> electrodes where "C<sub>Î¦</sub>" is almost constant within 5% over that voltage range. Some other transition-metal oxides behave similarly but only over smaller operating voltage ranges, about 0.6 to 0.8 V (Conway, 1997).
<p>
The case of RuO<sub>2</sub> pseudocapacitance provides one of the best examples of electrochemical (pseudo)capacitance as its "C<sub>Î¦</sub>" is almost constant over a 1.4 V voltage (Figure 6) range and its reversibility is excellent, with a <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c11"> cycle life</a> over several hundred-thousand cycles. However, its cost prevents its large-scale use so that it has been employed mainly in military applications.
<p>
Another type of material exhibiting quasi-redox behavior that is highly reversible is the family of <a href="art-c05-condpol.htm"><em> conducting polymers</em></a> such as polyaniline or derivatives of polythiophene. These are cheaper than ruthenium dioxide but are less stable, giving only thousands of cycles (still quite attractive) over a voltage range between 0.8 V and up to 3.0 V for some materials.
<p>
Figure 6 shows the contrast between a reversibly charged electrochemical capacitor material (RuO<sub>2</sub>) and an irreversibly chargeable battery-type material (Pb/PbCl<sub>2</sub>).
