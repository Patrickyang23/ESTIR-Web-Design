<h3> Basic process</h3>


An electroless solution typically consists of:

<ol type="a">
<li>  a source of metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a>; 
<li> a reducing agent, or <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r29"> reductant</a>, such as formaldehyde for copper 
deposition and hypophosphite for nickel deposition; 
<li> a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c119"> complexant</a> for the metal ions to keep these dissolved ions in solution, and to minimize homogenous 
reaction between the metal ions and the reducing agent;
<li> most likely a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a> adjustment <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#b08"> buffer</a>; 
<li> often a few <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p90"> ppm</a> of a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalytic</a> poison, such as lead ions, to stop 
unwanted plating on the walls of the tank, hoses, pumps,  miscellaneous particles in the solution, and on inert 
regions of the sample undergoing electroless deposition;
<li> oxygen gas dissolved in solution, which is invariably present, may also undergo 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a>, and which can influence deposition uniformity due to 
non-planar <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d19"> diffusion</a>.
</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>

A highly-dispersed catalyst, usually palladium, is often deposited on the surface to be plated on to initiate 
plating; palladium is a good catalyst for oxidation of most electroless reducing agents.
<p>
The basic electroless deposition process may be outlined as follows. <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e106"> 
Electrons</a> derived from <em>heterogeneous</em> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> of a 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r28"> reducing agent</a> at a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalytically 
active</a> region of the surface reduce metal<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01">  ions</a> to metal 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a33"> atoms</a>, which deposit on the surface, and a continuous metal deposit 
will be obtained under the right conditions. (See also the <a href="#app1"> Appendix</a>.) Trace additives like 
lead may also undergo deposition as described, and, as mentioned, dissolved oxygen gas may also undergo a 
parasitic reduction reaction at the plating surface. The initial catalytically active region is normally a metal 
catalyst, often highly dispersed palladium that is active for oxidation of most common electroless reducing 
agents. However, undesired deposition may also occur at catalytically active sites on container walls (scratches, 
adsorbed metal particles), and at small particles in solution, which may exhibit some catalytic activity for 
reductant oxidation due to the relatively high energy of their surfaces and the presence of active sites.

<h3> Mixed potential theory and electroless deposition </h3> 

Electroless deposition suffered from the lack of a detailed model describing it for a further couple of decades 
after Brenner's discovery of a stable electroless process, until the application of 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m36"> mixed potential</a> theory to it in the late 1960s by Paunovic and Saito, 
who worked independently.  With regard to the above described process where 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e106"> electrons</a> reduce metal ions to metal atoms, which represents the 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m02"> metal deposition</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#h01"> half reaction</a> in electroless deposition, in a simplistic sense we see that it is analogous to an
 <a href="art-e01-electroplat.htm"><em> electrodeposition process</em></a>.  With respect to the reducing
 agent reaction, organic and relatively complex inorganic oxidation reactions have similarly been widely studied 
electrochemically. It is therefore reasonable to think that electroless deposition could be described, or modeled, 
using an electrochemical approach. 
<p>
In the absence of a reducing agent, a metal electrode in a solution of its ions along with a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c119"> complexant</a> tends to 
exhibit an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o06"> open circuit potential</a> (OCP), although it may not be close 
to the expected theoretical value for a variety of reasons. The same metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e20"> 
electrode</a> placed in a solution containing an appropriate <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r28"> reducing 
agent</a>, for example, formaldehyde in the case of copper, but no metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> 
ions</a>, will also tend to generate a characteristic OCP. In a complete electroless solution, it is natural to 
inquire about the relationship of the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e66"> potential</a> measured at an electrode 
experiencing electroless deposition to the potentials of the individual <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a02"> anodic</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r29"> reductant</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c03"> cathodic</a> 
metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a> reactions. 

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"> General principles</img></em></h3> 

In 1966, advancing the notion that an electroless deposition process could be modeled using a simple 
electrochemical approach, Paunovic and Saito argued that the potential of a surface undergoing electroless 
deposition could be regarded as a "mixed" potential intermediate in value between the potentials of its 
constituent anodic and cathodic 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p41"> partial reactions</a>. These authors employed the
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m36">  mixed potential</a> concept of <a href="art-c02-corrosion.htm"><em> corrosion reactions</em></a> first outlined in a systematic manner by Wagner and Traud in 1938. The latter reported 
that zinc dissolution from zinc <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a40"> amalgam</a> was dependent on the 
amalgam <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e168"> electrochemical potential</a>, but independent of the 
accompanying <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#h17"> hydrogen evolution partial reaction</a>. In the 
Paunovic-Saito adaptation of this model, the partial electroless reactions occur simultaneously on the plating 
surface, resulting in the development of an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e29"> equilibrium potential</a> 
 intermediate in value between the reversible potentials, in practice the experimentally-determined 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o06"> open circuit potential</a> values, of the anodic and cathodic partial reactions. 
<p>
In the mixed potential theory (MPT) model, both partial reactions occur randomly on the surface, both with 
respect to time and space. However, given the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalytic</a> nature of the 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r29"> reductant</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation 
reaction</a>, it may be contended that such a reaction would tend to favor active sites on the surface, especially 
at the onset of deposition, and especially on an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i24"> insulator</a> surface 
catalyzed with palladium nuclei (a standard practice used to initiate electroless deposition on a catalytically-inactive, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#n38"> nonconducting</a> substrate). Since each reaction strives to reach its own equilibrium potential and impose 
this on the surface, a situation is achieved in which a compromise potential, known as the mixed potential, 
"E<sub>mp</sub>", is assumed by the surface.

being raised above "E<sup>o</sup><sub>Red</sub>", and that of the metal deposition reaction being 
depressed cathodically from "E<sup>o</sup><sub>Mz+</sub>". Assuming an electroless system follows MPT, 
the rate of metal deposition equals the rate of reductant oxidation at "E<sub>mp</sub>"; the actual polarization 
curve for the full electroless solution may be constructed from the respective polarization curves of the partial 
reactions over some finite potential region relevant to practical electroless deposition.

A discussion of the applicability of the MPT model to a particular electroless system ideally presumes 
knowledge of the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r15"> mechanisms</a> of the anodic and cathodic 
partial reactions, and experimental verification of the interdependence or otherwise of these reactions. Aspects 
of the kinetics, <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalysis</a>, and mechanistic aspects of electroless deposition will be discussed separately.

Paunovic (1968) reported that an electroless copper solution containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 
complexant for copper <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a>, formaldehyde reductant, with 
<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a> = 12.5, and operated at 25<sup>o</sup>C, exhibited behavior 
generally in accord with MPT; the polarization curves for reduction of copper ions and oxidation of formaldehyde 
are shown in Figure 2. The intersection potential for these curves was found to be similar to the value of the 
equilibrium, or <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o06"> open circuit</a>, potential of a copper electrode undergoing electroless deposition in the complete 
solution. Similarly, the rate of copper deposition estimated at "E<sub>mp</sub>" in Figure 2 
(2.2 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m74"> mg</a>/h/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a>) was close to the value measured gravimetrically for an electrolessly-plated 
substrate, 1.8 ± 0.2 mg/h/cm<sup>2</sup>. A number of other workers have reported that their 
electroless copper formulations also behaved in a manner consistent with MPT.

<br clear="left"/>   <p>

The MPT model was also reported to apply in a number other electroless metal deposition systems, including:
<ol type="a">
<li> electroless nickel from a citrate-<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c119">complexant</a> containing solution with dimethylamine borane (DMAB) <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r29"> reductant</a> (Paunovic, 1983)
<li> electroless gold deposition from a gold cyanide containing solution, which utilized potassium borohydride as reducing agent (Okinaka,1973)
<li> more recently, cobalt-tungsten-phosphorus alloy (tungsten concentration not given, but probably was a few 
atomic %)  from a solution that utilized sodium hypophosphite  as reducing agent and ammonium tungstate as 
the source of  tungsten <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a> (Shacham-Diamand and Sverdlov, 2000).
</li></li></li></ol>
<p>
Though the simplicity and elegance of the MPT model have motivated much electrochemical type investigation of electroless systems, there are reports of solutions that do not operate in accord with MPT, including conflicting reports from different groups for electroless systems that appear on the surface to be similar. There are several possible reasons for this variability in observations between the various groups, including the following:

<ol type="a">
<li> the use of different metal ion complexants, which invariably leads to varying activities of free metal ions in solution
<li> different solution temperatures and pH;
<li> varying <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentrations</a> and types of additives used as solution stabilizers;
<li> the presence of varying concentrations of dissolved oxygen which undergoes a parallel <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a> reaction;
<li> the use of different solution agitation conditions which has direct impact on the concentration of additive or dissolved oxygen at the surface;
<li> the use of somewhat different methods to obtain <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p48"> polarization curves</a> (pseudo steady state against <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p45"> potential sweep method</a> carried out at different sweep rates);
<li> use of chemicals of different grades of purity. 
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>

It would seem that it is difficult to argue that the surface of a metal in a solution not containing the reducing agent is the same as the surface in the presence of the latter, especially bearing in mind that the reducing agents in conventional electroless solutions strongly <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorb</a> on the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a> surface. Therefore, in principle it would seem to be virtually impossible to have a typical electroless system strictly adhere to the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m36"> mixed potential</a> model. Nevertheless, this model has considerably stimulated basic electrochemical studies of electroless systems that otherwise would probably not have been carried out.

<h3> Catalytic aspects</h3> 

The critical reaction in electroless deposition from the viewpoint of <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalysis</a> is oxidation of the reducing agent. The ability to catalyze oxidation of the reductant determines whether a metal or alloy can sustain electroless deposition in an otherwise properly formulated electroless solution. 
<p>
An interesting feature of the electroless deposition process is that no one metal appears to be a good catalyst for oxidation of all reducing agents that have been employed for electroless deposition. Thus, copper is an exceptional catalyst for formaldehyde oxidation, but is inactive for hypophosphite oxidation from a practical standpoint. Nickel and cobalt are poor catalysts for hydrogen oxidation, but are good catalysts for virtually every other reducing agent relevant to electroless deposition.  Palladium appears to come closest as an example of a good catalyst for all reducing agents; however, it is likely that one could find a catalyst that could match, if not exceed, its activity in the case of each reductant.  This, combined with its <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#n24"> nobility</a>, or resistance to dissolution in electroless solutions and to excessive oxidation, has made palladium the universal choice as a catalyst for initiating electroless deposition at catalytically-inactive metals and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i24"> insulators</a>.

Figure 3 shows polarization curves for the anodic <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> of formaldehyde at various metal electrodes recorded in a solution maintained at 25<sup>o</sup>C and containing EDTA (a commonly used complexant in electroless copper solutions) and maintained at a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a> = 12.5 (Ohno, 1985). After exhibiting exceptional activity at potentials less than -0.8 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#v09"> V</a> (<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#s12">SCE</a>), the activity of copper decreased about 0.3 V (SCE); this region of activity is more than adequate for electroless deposition of copper. Although they exhibit excellent catalytic activity for other important reducing agents such as hypophosphite and dimethylamine borane, cobalt and nickel exhibit negligible catalytic activity for formaldehyde oxidation. 
<p>
Similar polarization curve data has been obtained by Ohno (1985) for other important <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r28"> reducing agents</a>. In an effort to classify the activity of various metal electrodes for the reducing agents, Ohno tabulated the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e66"> potentials</a> exhibited by the reducing agents for a fixed <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c09"> current density</a> of 
1.0 Ã— 10<sup>-4</sup><a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a21"> A</a>/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c122">cm<sup>2</sup></a>; this data is tabulated in Figure 4 (catalytic activity of course increases on going from high to low potentials). Although the data in Figure 4 indicates trends that may be useful in designing electroless solutions, it refers to particular experimental conditions, and may not adequately describe catalytic activity behavior in different types of electroless solutions.

<h3> Mechanistic aspects</h3>
<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Nickel-phosphorus</em></h3> 

The shapes of the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p48"> polarization curves</a> shown in Figure 3, including those generally observed for other reducing agents, are invariably complex, and not representative of simple electrochemical reactions. From the inception of modern electroless deposition practice, a number of <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r15"> mechanisms</a> have been advanced to describe the electroless deposition process, many of which dealt with nickel-phosphorus. The classical mechanisms include the following: 

<ol type="a">
<li><em>adsorbed atomic hydrogen</em> was first postulated to be the reducing agent for nickel ion;
<li><em>hydride</em> ions as the purported reducing species;
<li><em>metal hydroxide</em>, in which hydrolyzed nickel ions were involved in mechanism of electroless deposition;
<li>An <em>electrochemical mechanism</em>, in which the deposition of nickel-phosphorus was an electrochemical process that occurred through <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#l11"> local cells</a> on the surface.
</li></li></li></li></ol>
Despite the fact that each mechanism was originally proposed for essentially the same deposition process, namely nickel-phosphorus, each mechanism has a uniquely distinct feature to it.  For example, mechanism (a) involves <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorbed</a> atomic hydrogen as the reducing agent, in contradistinction to mechanism (b) which involves hydride <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a>. Further discussion of these mechanisms may be seen in this writer's review article (O'Sullivan, 2001).
<p>
It is apparent from this review of electroless nickel-phosphorus deposition, by far the most important technological example of an electroless process with hypophosphite as reducing agent, that the mechanism for this reaction is still not fully understood. (See also the <a href="#app2"> Appendix</a>.)

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Electroless copper</em></h3> 

In contrast to typical solutions based on hypophosphite and dimethylamine borane reducing agents, which involve to co-deposition of phosphorus and boron, respectively, electroless copper tends to results in virtually 100% pure copper. Although <a href="art-e01-electroplat.htm"><em> electroplated </em></a> copper has recently taken center stage as a replacement for aluminum interconnects in the back-end-of –line (BEOL) structures in ultralarge scale integrated (ULSI) technology, electroless copper has had much success in the past in a number of areas of microelectronics, for example, in generating the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c50"> conductors</a> in high-end glass epoxy circuit boards. In contrast to electroplated copper, which requires a global seed layer, electroless copper is readily selectively deposited on patterned, electrically isolated, circuit elements on suitably catalyzed (usually with dispersed, sub-<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c116">colloidal</a> palladium) <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d59"> dielectric</a> surfaces. 
<p>
Electroless copper has not been as widely investigated as the electroless nickel processes. Similarly, its mechanism does not appear to have been adequately described in the technical literature. Formaldehyde  is still by far the most common reducing agent used to promote electroless copper deposition, usually in solution of <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a> = 10.5-12.5. Formaldehyde undergoes oxidation to formic acid or formate, depending on pH, a process that has a standard potential of +0.056 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#v09"> V</a> (<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#s09">SHE</a>); the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#s13"> standard potential</a> for the copper <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r26"> redox couple</a> is 0.34 V (SHE). See the <a href="#app3"> Appendix</a> for some proposed mechanisms.

<h3> Hydrogen evolution in electroless deposition</h3> 

The co-<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#h17">evolution of hydrogen gas</a> in most electroless deposition processes is an aspect of electroless deposition which needs to be understood, since it is integral part of the electroless deposition process for the majority of electroless solutions, and since it also impacts the properties of deposits by hydrogen inclusion. 
<p>
In a study of formaldehyde electrooxidation at various metals, Bindra and Tweedie (1985) provided insight into the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> of formaldehyde in the context of the differences of the energy of hydrogen <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorption</a> on various metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c101"> catalyst</a> surfaces. Dividing the latter into three categories, depending on their formaldehyde oxidation behavior they noted the following correlation:

<ol type="a">
<li> in the case of metals with <em>positive</em> energy of hydrogen adsorption, such as copper, formaldehyde oxidation is accompanied by hydrogen gas evolution;
<li> in the case of metals with energy of hydrogen adsorption close to <em>zero</em>, such as platinum and palladium, formaldehyde oxidation is not accompanied by hydrogen evolution;
<li> in the case of metals with negative energy of hydrogen adsorption, such as nickel, the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> of formaldehyde oxidation are extremely slow relative to the other two classes; these  metals cannot be electrolessly deposited from solutions containing formaldehyde as a reducing agent.

</li></li></li></ol>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, coevolution of hydrogen also occurs for other reducing agents employed in electroless solutions. A consequence of the involvement of adsorbed hydrogen intermediates in electroless deposition is that <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a32"> absorption</a> of hydrogen occurs in the deposit, the extent of which depends on the deposit type (for example, less for copper than for palladium). If care is not taken in the case of palladium deposits, for example, films can deform and crack from stress minutes after removal from the electroless solution, due to rapid removal of the absorbed hydrogen from the metal. See the <a href="#app4"> Appendix</a> for mechanistic details.

<p>
Lacking the high-energy bombardment aspect of vacuum deposition, the electroless deposition process lacks a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r15"> mechanism</a> for deposits to adhere well to smooth <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i24"> insulator</a> surfaces in the absence of special surface functionalization pretreatments. Compounding this problem is the stress caused by <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a32"> absorbed</a> hydrogen. As solutions become more and more free of particles through constantly improving filtration methods, fewer particle-related nucleation sites, for example, hydrophobic organic material, exist for generating hydrogen gas bubbles in solution. Eventually, this can result in nucleation of hydrogen bubbles in "active" sites in the weak structural link of the insulator/deposit/solution system, namely the insulator/deposit interface, and film delamination may result.

<h3> Alloy deposition</h3> 

Electroless deposition, with only a few exceptions, yields an alloy deposit, such as nickel-phosphorus. The present discussion principally deals with ternary and quaternary alloy deposits, for example, nickel-X-phosphorus in the case of electroless nickel-phosphorus-based alloys, where X is a third metal or element. Alloy deposition is thus an important feature of electroless deposition due to the ability to create new materials with interesting, and often unique, properties, such as good <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d19"> diffusion</a> barrier, <a href="art-c02-corrosion.htm"><em> corrosion</em></a> resistance, and magnetic properties. For a survey of the range of metals and elements which have been codeposited in electroless alloys, the reader is referred to Ohno (1998).

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Alloys containing mainly catalytically active metals</em></h3> 

Magnetic recording has been a major driving force behind research into electroless cobalt alloys. Since this subject has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (Okinaka, 1994), attention in this section will focus primarily on a few recent examples illustrative of the alloy deposition reaction. Electroless alloys containing boron possess somewhat different physical properties to the analogous phosphorus containing alloys, and despite the higher cost of dimethylamine borane  reducing agent relative to hypophosphite, they continue to receive attention. 
<p>
In a recent study of nickel-cobalt alloy deposition using dimethylamine borane in the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a> range 4-8, Saito (1998) observed that the rate of deposition of nickel-cobalt-boron increased with increasing nickel content of the alloy, which is consistent with higher catalytic activity on the part of nickel-boron for dimethylamine borane <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e116"> electrooxidation</a>. Similarly, boron content increased with increasing nickel content, which is most likely due to the higher catalytic activity exhibited by nickel-boron for boron deposition, and not an energetic predisposition. Saito also noted that the boron content in the alloy tended to be inversely proportional to deposition rate. It was also noted that the partial <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c09"> current densities</a> measured at the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m36"> mixed potential</a> values for cobalt-boron and nickel-boron solutions without <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r28"> reducing agent</a> were much lower that the deposition rates determined by mass gain at electrolessly plating substrates. This indicated <em>interaction</em> between the partial <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a02"> anodic</a> (reducing agent oxidation) and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c03"> cathodic</a> reactions (metal reduction, but also some phosphorus and boron reduction), and that a simple mixed potential model of electroless deposition (obtained by simply adding the anodic and cathodic <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p41"> partial reaction</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p48"> polarization curves</a>) was incapable of describing the electroless solutions.
<p>
The incorporation of a third element, for example, copper, in electroless nickel-phosphorus coatings has been suggested to improve thermal stability and other properties of these coatings. Chassaing (1993) carried out an electrochemical study of electroless deposition of nickel-copper-phosphorus alloys (55-65% nickel, 25-35% copper, 7-10% phosphorus). As mentioned earlier, pure copper surfaces do not <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalyze</a> the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> of hypophosphite. They observed interactions between the anodic and cathodic processes: both reactions exhibited faster <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> in the full electroless solutions than their respective half cell environments (mixed potential theory model is apparently inapplicable). The mechanism responsible for this enhancement has not been clearly established, however.

Chassaing (1993) noted that copper was always preferentially deposited compared to nickel, its <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a> in the electroless deposit being larger than in the solution; this behavior is in accord with the more noble character of copper. As has been observed in several other ternary systems, phosphorus incorporation in the deposit decreased when the copper content increased. Similar results were reported by Nawafune which are outlined in Figure 5. 
<p>
Clearly the rate of phosphorus deposition decreases along with the phosphorus content in the deposit, that is, it appears that it is not simply a case here of the sluggish phosphorus deposition reaction being dominated by the faster kinetics of the copper deposition reaction. Chassaing tentatively suggested that there existed an interaction between the phosphorus and copper deposition reactions. However, it may simply be the case that a small amount of nickel acts as a catalyst for hypophosphite oxidation, and the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e106"> electrons</a> derived from this reaction are conducted to sites where copper ions gets reduced to copper metal. The faster kinetics of copper deposition would then be largely due to the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e66"> potential</a> of the copper <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r26"> couple</a> being considerably more <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#n24"> noble</a> than that of the nickel one. The difference in deposition <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> are thus based on energetic factors in this instance, especially since the stability constants of the citrate-copper complexes do not exceed the stability constants of the citrate-nickel <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c119"> complexes</a> by a large margin. 
<p>
Gold continues to be an important metal in the microelectronics industry. It can be electrolessly deposited using, for example, a borohydride solution. Molenaar (1982) used more novel thiosulfate-based solutions and studied deposition of a range of gold-copper alloys from an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a19"> alkaline</a> solution containing formaldehyde reducing agent, gold cyanide, and copper <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ions</a> complexed with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). In an electroless type solution, due to virtually complete inhibition by cyanide of the catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde on gold, the stable gold cyanide complex did not undergo reduction. However, introducing copper into the solution enabled Molenaar to obtain alloy deposits with gold content ranging from 5 to 99%. In order to have a sustained electroless reaction, it was necessary to have a small amount of catalytically active copper present on the surface the deposit to enable oxidation of the formaldehyde. The gold-copper deposits contained homogeneous mixed crystals with a characteristic lattice constant for each composition, a linear relationship between lattice content and metal content being obtained.

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Alloys containing catalytically inactive metals</em></h3> 

For practical as well as fundamental reasons, there has been considerable interest in the deposition of alloys containing metals such as tungsten, molybdenum, and tin. In their pure forms, these metals do not <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalyze</a> the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> of the usual electroless <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r28"> reducing agents</a>. Therefore, their <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r15"> mechanism</a> of codeposition is intriguing, and developing an understanding of it should help to better understand the mechanism of electroless deposition as whole. Obvious questions in ternary and quaternary alloy deposition include the effect of the third- or fourth-element-containing-<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01">ions</a> in solution on the rate of electroless deposition, as well as on the phosphorus and boron contents in the case of alloys based on nickel-phosphorus and nickel-boron.

Bangwei (1996) studied the influence of solution variables on the electroless deposition of nickel-tungsten-phosphorus. Using citric acid as a complexant for both nickel and tungstate ions, they observed maxima as a function of tungstate <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a> in solution in the phosphorus and tungsten contents of the deposits (Figure 6a) and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> of electroless deposition (Figure 6b); the influence of citric acid on these three quantities is shown in Figures 6(c and d). The increase in deposition rate with tungstate concentration may be due to consumption of citrate by tungstate, thereby increasing the concentration of the reactive uncomplexed nickel ions. The rapid decrease in phosphorus and tungsten compositions at concentrations greater than 0.05 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m44"> mol</a>/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d75">dm<sup>3</sup></a> (Figure 6a) may be due to an enhancement of the kinetics of nickel on reduction as the effective concentration, or activity, of citrate complexant is decreased through complexation with tungstate ions. The decrease in deposition rate with increase in citrate concentration shown in Figure 6c is probably due to the decrease in concentration of uncomplexed nickel ions as the concentration of citrate increases. However, the composition data shown in Figure 6c is difficult to interpret. 
<p>
As summarized in O'Sullivan (2001), similar complex data has been reported for nickel-tin-phosphorus and nickel-tungsten-phosphorus alloy electroless deposition. Many of the studies in the literature concerning electroless alloys are difficult to comprehend from the viewpoint of deposition <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> and mechanism. This is often due to the nature of the complexant used, which many times functions to complex not only the primary metal ion, such as nickel, but also the secondary metal, or element, ion. Thus, changing the concentration of the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#l22"> ligand</a> in solution changes not only the concentration, or <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a10"> activity</a>, of the free, or hexaquo, metal ion, but also that of the other species of ion undergoing deposition. Also, changing the concentration of the primary metal ion in solution alters the concentration of ligand available for <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c119"> complexing</a> the secondary ion, also changing its free ion concentration, and so on. Having such interdependent concentrations of reacting ions in solution makes it difficult to extract the maximum possible information from fundamental studies of ternary alloy electroless solutions. 
<p>
Electroless nickel-germanium-phosphorus was studied by this writer as a model system for ternary alloy deposition (O'Sullivan, 1993). A chloride-free solution with germanium oxide as a source of germanium, hypophosphite as reducing agent, aspartic acid as a selective complexant for nickel  ions, which was operated at 80ºC in the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a> range of 5-5.8, was developed for depositing nickel-germanium-phosphorus films with a tunable germanium content from 0 to 25+ atomic %. The use of a complexant such as citric acid, which complexed germanium ions <em>as well</em> as nickel ions, resulted in a much lower germanium content in the electroless deposit, and a more complicated solution to study for the reasons discussed above. The aspartate-containing electroless solution, with its non-complexing pH <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#b08"> buffer</a> (succinic acid), approximated a "modular" system, and, with the exception of the aspartic acid-nickel complexation reaction, exhibited a minimum level of interactions in solution.

<h3> Other solution factors: additives and dissolved oxygen gas</h3> 

Although electroless deposition seems to offer greater prospects for deposit thickness and composition uniformity than electrodeposition, the achievement of such uniformity is a challenge. An understanding of catalysis and mechanism, as discussed earlier, is often insufficient to describe the operation of a practical electroless solution. Solution factors, such as stabilizers, dissolved oxygen gas, and partially-<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d58">diffusion-controlled</a>, metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ion</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a> reactions, often can strongly influence deposit uniformity. In the field of microelectronics, backend-of-line (BEOL) linewidths can be significantly less than 0.1 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m67"> µm</a>, which is much less than the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d28"> diffusion layer</a> thickness for a typical solution stabilizer additive, whose concentration may be 1 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p90"> ppm</a> (about 1-2 Ã— 10<sup>-5</sup> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m44"> mol</a>/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d75">dm<sup>3</sup></a> lead). Good electroless deposit uniformity is expected to be difficult to achieve, especially in cases where a range of feature sizes is involved. As will be seen below, one cannot simply immerse a substrate with a nonuniformly distributed mask pattern into just any electroless deposition solution and expect to obtain uniform deposit thickness and composition. However, the situation can be significantly helped by good mask layout involving arrays of closely-spaced small circuit features, and avoiding isolated features, which may be subjected to non-planar diffusion of solution components. 

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Solution additives</em></h3> 

Strongly adsorbing solution stabilizers, for example, lead ions are often added to electroless solutions to prevent extraneous deposition. Such additives strongly impede the kinetics of reductant oxidation through an adsorption process: they are <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalytic</a> poisons. While suitable complexation of the metal ion(s) undergoing reduction reactions can yield a high degree of electroless solution stability, it is not always sufficient. This is because electroless deposition, being a catalytic process, can initiate at a variety of active sites in a complex deposition tool. The stabilizer additives adsorb on such sites, including on miscellaneous particles, and inhibit reductant oxidation, and hence deposition. Too high a concentration of additive at a catalytically active surface, brought about by either too high a concentration of additive in solution or as a consequence of hydrodynamics, can either prevent deposition from initiating, or can stop the deposition process.
<p>
Adsorbed additives also tend to undergo <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a> during the electroless process, and become incorporated as impurities into deposits, most likely through a mechanism similar to that involved in ternary alloy deposition. In a manner similar to that discussed below in greater detail for dissolved oxygen, electroless deposition rates will be lower for features smaller than the stabilizer <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d28"> diffusion layer</a> thickness. The <em>edges</em> of larger features, which experience higher stabilizer levels due to enhanced nonplanar diffusion, may experience reduced deposition rates, or may remain uncoated in extreme cases. 

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Dissolved oxygen gas</em></h3> 

Oxygen gas is normally present in electroless solutions; unless steps are taken to reduce its concentration by inert gas purging, the concentration of dissolved oxygen usually approaches 10<sup>-5</sup> <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m44"> mol</a>/<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d75">dm<sup>3</sup></a> at room temperature. In contrast to deliberately added solution stabilizers, the oxygen molecule tends to <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorb</a> weakly on catalytically active surfaces, where it may or may not undergo <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d21"> dissociation</a>. Since at many metallic surfaces it is capable of being reduced via either a 2-electron or a 4-electron reaction route, the dissolved oxygen gas affects the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m36"> mixed potential</a> of the surface being coated in the electroless solution.
<p>
At most active <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e79"> electrocatalysts</a>, including those of interest for electroless deposition, for example, palladium, the oxygen reduction reaction occurs at significant <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o07"> overpotentials</a> under conditions of <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d58"> diffusion control</a>. Thus, geometric effects related to size and distribution of plating features tend to be somewhat similar for both stabilizers and dissolved oxygen. For large-area substrates, the effect of dissolved oxygen on the kinetics of electroless deposition will generally be uniform throughout the substrate, except for edge regions. However, nonplanar diffusion effects on the kinetics of deposition need to be considered for feature sizes less than the oxygen <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d28"> diffusion layer</a> thickness, the magnitude of which will be determined by hydrodynamics and temperature.
<p>
The oxygen reduction reaction affects not only the steady-state deposition kinetics, but also the initiation of deposition, the so-called induction time. At the beginning of the deposition process, the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o06"> open circuit potential</a>, "E<sub>oc</sub>", of either a uniformly catalytically active substrate, or a catalyst particle on an <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i24"> insulator</a>, will be higher than that required for electroless deposition to occur. This is a consequence of the surface of the catalyst being covered with oxygen or hydroxide species which mask the catalytic activity of the surface; the value of "E<sub>oc</sub>" would be expected to be in the range of +0.5 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#v09"> V</a> to + 0.7 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#v09"> V</a> (<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r39">RHE</a>) for a palladium surface. Normally, this is <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a02"> anodic</a>, or positive, with respect to the "E<sub>m</sub>" value of the electroless reaction (Figure 1). Following removal of the oxide species from the catalyst surface, whether deposition subsequently initiates or not depends on the interplay between the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> of the parallel metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ion</a> and oxygen <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> reduction</a> reactions, and <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> of the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r28"> reducing agent</a>. Once an appropriate "E<sub>m</sub>" value is reached, metal deposition will occur.
<p>
In the absence of well laid out mask design, the presence of solution stabilizers and dissolved oxygen gas may impart a practical lower limit to the feature size that can be reproducibly fabricated using a particular electroless deposition; solution agitation will play a major role in determining this practical feature-size limit. Optimized electroless plating solutions which contain stabilizers to minimize particle generation and improve metallurgical properties, yet also contain dissolved oxygen, may not always be the best electroless solutions to employ in deposition in areas such as nanotechnology, unless the nano-sized features are uniformly laid out with close spacing in arrays, ideally with "fill" structures surrounding the arrays.

Electroless deposition can produces coatings with a high degree of uniformity, especially if the sizes of the features being plated exceed the diffusion layer thickness of critical components of the electroless solution, and are of complex shape (Figure 7-left). In addition, electroless nickel-phosphorus can produce coatings with varying properties because of the ability to readily control the phosphorus content, which significantly alters deposit properties, such as corrosion resistance and wear resistance.  It is not surprising therefore that electroless nickel phosphorus is by far the most widely used electroless process in industry, with virtually innumerable uses stretching from computers and electronics to the automotive, aerospace, and oil and chemical industries.
<p>
In printed-circuit board manufacturing, electroless nickel phosphorus is commonly used as a coating with an overlay of gold to prevent <a href="art-c02-corrosion.htm"><em> corrosion</em></a>, for example for connectors; the gold is put down by a self-limiting, chemical-displacement process.  Electroless nickel is also used extensively in the manufacture of hard disk drives (Figure 7-right), as a magnetically neutral, smooth base coating on aluminum-based substrates (disks) prior to application of the magnetic read/write coating, which is usually done by physical vapor deposition ("sputtering"), and finishing with protective carbon and lubrication layers.
<br clear="left"/>   <p>
Electroless copper development underwent a quantum leap as a result of its use in
printed wiring board (PWB) fabrication, where it is often referred to as <em>additive technology</em>. It was used for plating fine-line conductors and high-aspect-ratio through-holes, which ran from top to bottom of the multilayer circuit board, because of its high "throwing power" (the ability of a plating solution to cover uniformly) compared to the then-available copper <a href="art-e01-electroplat.htm"><em> 
electroplating</em></a> processes. In the 1970s, IBM used this technology for the manufacture of multilayer circuit boards (MLBs) to package multichip modules, on which were mounted the logic chips, in its then top-of-the-line mainframe computers. This use of electroless copper led to much research and optimization of the process within and outside IBM, especially in the area of bath stability and the surface <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalyzation</a> using palladium <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c116">colloidal</a>-type "solutions".

A cross-sectional drawing of an IBM multilayer circuit board is shown in Figure 8. In practice, manufactured boards contained 20 or more layers of printed circuits, sandwiched together within a thickness of a little less than 5 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m64"> mm</a>. While the 600 Ã— 700 mm dimensions of the boards still exceeds by a large amount today's 300 mm silicon wafer, it was in giving a uniform coating of copper on the high-aspect ratio through-holes where the electroless copper processes excelled in terms of uniformity of copper coverage, longterm solution stability, aided by the excellence of the palladium colloid surface catalysts. While electroless copper has been eclipsed by copper <a href="art-e01-electroplat.htm"><em> electrodeposition</em></a> in the so-called back-end-of-line (BEOL) CMOS area of ULSI silicon integrated circuit technology, due to copper electrodeposition's better "Damascene" interconnect feature filling characteristics, the former process will continue to be of interest in niche applications, such as printed wiring boards, sometimes as part of a hybrid electroless-electrodeposition process. 
<p>
Nanostructured materials, such as nanoparticles, nanowires and nanoarrays, have attracted much attention due to their interesting electronic, optical and chemical properties. Electroless deposition has shown initial promise for fabricating nanostructures in this emerging field of research. This is not surprising, since an electrical connection is not needed to be set up to a nano-feature, as would be the case with electrodeposition (for example, using a <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c50"> conductive</a> seedlayer), it being necessary to only set up the appropriate surface and electroless solution conditions for localized electroless deposition to proceed. Thus, several publications have appeared describing electroless deposition in nanopores, for example.

Researchers from McGill University in Montreal reported forming electroless nanowires of palladium by self-assembly on a rough stainless steel substrate (but with no nanotube involvement) in which the palladium nanowires were assembled from their constituent nanoparticles in a "bead-by-bead" manner as depicted in Figure 9. The remarkable self-organization embodied in the nanowires seems to be due to the reduction of surface energy caused by the aligning of the nanoparticles in a highly ordered wire.  This self-organization even extended to network formation, where nodes linked palladium nanowires. It should noted that the nanowires followed directions that seemed independent of surface defects, hence the apparent self-assembly attribute. It is reasonable to expect that similar structures will eventually be formed for other types of metals and alloys using electroless, or pseudo-electroless, deposition solutions.

<h3> Conclusions and future of electroless deposition</h3> 

The <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r15"> mechanism</a> of electroless deposition remains unclear. Given the complexity and variety of electroless deposition solutions available for study, this is not surprising. Another reason is that electroless deposition reactions have, for the most part, not been studied with the same rigor and intensity as have the hydrogen, oxygen, and methanol <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e09"> electrode reactions</a>. In part this is due to the electroless deposition processes in the main working adequately well, generally in a short-term batch manner. The <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.htm"><em> fuel cell</em></a> related reactions have always held out the promise of bountiful energy, but have not yet delivered on those promises, hence the sustained study of such electrode reactions.
<p>
Continuing interest in electroless deposition for microelectronics, which is relentlessly morphing into nanoelectronics, is generating fresh thinking on how best to apply electroless deposition to extremely small, and closely-spaced features (below 0.1 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m67"> µm</a>). The traditional methods of <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalyzing</a> the copper surface with palladium catalyst to initiate deposition invariably result in unacceptable copper surface roughness, and difficulties with completely removing the catalyst from the inter layer <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d59"> dielectric</a> (ILD) regions, results in unacceptable levels of shorts. Also, traditional electroless solutions with low-concentration additives appear to be unsuitable for future microelectronic applications due to related deposit nonuniformity issues. 
<p>
Initial efforts to generate short-lived electroless solutions at point of use, thereby avoiding the nonuniformity effects of additives, and to obtain electroless deposits without the use of palladium catalyst, have yielded encouraging results in the case of the self-aligned metal capping layer cobalt-tungsten-phosphorus and on copper interconnects, for example, in tests aimed at high performance logic chips at the 45 <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#n27"> nm</a> node and below. The main motivation for using these capping layers is to increase <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e44"> electromigration</a> lifetime, with improvements in electromigration lifetime of over 100 times having been reported for the cobalt-tungsten-phosphorus cap. Avoidance of a catalyst (palladium) for initiating electroless hypophosphite reducing agent-based electroless solution is made possible by heating the solutions to a high enough temperature immediately prior to contact with the wafer, such that the slow <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> of <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> of hypophosphite at the copper interconnect surface, a poor catalyst for this reaction, are overcome.
<p>
As with other processes reliant on chemicals, electroless deposition will be forced to adopt more environmentally-friendly chemicals, for example, replacing the formaldehyde reducing agent in the case of electroless copper.

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Mechanistic aspects of the nickel-phosphorus deposition</em></h3>

The failure of the proposed <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r15"> mechanisms</a>, and related variations, to provide a comprehensive picture of electroless deposition involving hypophosphite <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r28"> reducing agent</a> has sustained continuing investigations of the mechanism of electroless deposition. Observations such as co-<a href="../../ed/dict.htm#h17">evolution of hydrogen gas</a> known to be derived from the reductant in electroless deposition, that the electroless process only occurs on metals generally known to be good hydrogenation-dehydrogenation catalysts, that sulfur-containing poisons for the latter class of catalysts act as electroless solution stabilizers, and that electroless deposition rates more often than not increase with increase in solution <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a>, prompted van den Meerakker (1981) to postulate a general mechanism that involves <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r29"> reductant</a> adsorption followed by <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d21"> dissociation</a>. This may be outlined as follows:
<p>
[4] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> RH ==&gt; RH<sub>ads</sub>
<p>
[5] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/>    RH<sub>ads </sub>  ==&gt; R<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub> + H<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub>
<p>
[6] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> R<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub> + OH<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; ROH + e<sup>-</sup>
<p>
[7] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub> + H<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub> ==&gt; H<sub>2</sub>
<p>
Here, "RH" denotes the reducing agent, which yields the adsorbed <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r36"> radical</a> species "R<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub>" and atomic hydrogen upon <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorption</a> and dissociation; the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e106"> electron</a> derived from the <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#o01"> oxidation</a> step (Equation [6]) goes towards metal <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#i01"> ion</a> reduction. 
<p>
Van den Meerakker's mechanism as embodied in Equations [4-7] is shown here as a possible general mechanism for reducing agent oxidation in electroless deposition. This writer does not mean to imply that this is the "actual" mechanism of reducing agent oxidation, or that it applies to all surfaces under all deposition conditions. Rather, the mechanism appears to be a good starting point for the study of a mechanism in a particular metal-reducing agent system.
<p>
Though equations such as [4-7] may be considered to represent the core steps, or reactions, of the reductant oxidation process in conventional electroless deposition, one or more additional reactions often need to be considered. In the case of reductants such as hypophosphite and dimethylamine borane, codeposition of phosphorus and boron, respectively, also occurs, as shown here for hypophosphite in acidic solution:
<p>
[8] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>2</sub>PO<sup>-</sup><sub>2ads</sub> + 2H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; 4H<sub>2</sub>O + P-B film on substrate
<p>
Many factors influence the deposition <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> of phosphorus and boron, including metal ion complexant concentration, solution <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#p13"> pH</a>, and temperature. Though they are unavoidable side products of the electroless deposits, phosphorus and boron impart unique properties to electroless deposits, for example, good <a href="art-c02-corrosion.htm"><em> corrosion</em></a> resistance in the case of nickel-phosphorus deposits, where the phosphorus content can reach, or even exceed, 30 atomic % in certain solutions.
<p>
It is apparent from a review of electroless nickel-phosphorus deposition, by far the most important technological example of an electroless process with hypophosphite as reducing agent, that the mechanism for this reaction is still not fully understood. In the case of many of the solutions studied, it seems that a simple <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#m36"> mixed potential</a> model does not generally apply, which is not surprising when one sees, for example, the complexity of the steps in reactions [4-7], specifically the involvement of chemical steps, one of which is likely <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#r12"> rate limiting</a>.

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Mechanistic aspects of the electroless copper deposition</em></h3>

Formaldehyde  is still by far the most common reducing agent used to promote electroless copper deposition, In electroless solutions, formaldehyde undergoes transformation to a methylene glycolate <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a04"> anion</a>, which is the actual reducing agent in electroless deposition: 
<p>
[9] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>2</sub>CO + H<sub>2</sub>O ==&gt; H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="50"/> (methylene glycol is a weak <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a18"> acid</a>) 
<p>
[10] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub> + OH<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)O<sup>-</sup>  + H<sub>2</sub>O 
<p>
On copper, the overall <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a02"> anodic</a> reaction involving formaldehyde, or more correctly, the methylene glycolate anion may be depicted as:
<p>
[11] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)O<sup>-</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; HCOO<sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 0.5H<sub.2< sub=""> + e<sup>-</sup>
<p>
It is seen that one <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#e106"> electron</a> is obtained for each methylene glycolate anion on copper catalysts, although there is a possibility of obtaining two electrons if protons (or water in <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a19"> alkaline</a>  solution) were produced instead of hydrogen gas; the latter case tends to be observed at palladium and platinum catalysts (van Den Meerakker, 1981; Ohno, 1985; Bindra and Tweedie, 1985):
<p>
[12] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)O<sup>-</sup> + 2OH<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; HCOO<sup>-</sup> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2e<sup>-</sup>
<p>
Thus, formaldehyde is not an efficient reductant in electroless copper solutions, not that this is an issue, given its continuous depletion by the parasitic homogeneous Cannizarro reaction. Van den Meerakker (1981) proposed a mechanism for methylene glycolate oxidation at copper which included a step involving dehydrogenation of adsorbed methylene glycolate anion: 
<p>
[13] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)O<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)O<sup>-</sup><sub>ads</sub>
<p>
[14] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)O<sup>-</sup><sub>ads</sub> ==&gt; HC(OH)O<sup>-</sup><sub>ads</sub> + H<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="50"/> (rate determining step) 
<p>
[15] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/>   HC(OH)O<sup>-</sup><sub>ads</sub> + OH<sup>-</sup> ==&gt; HCOO<sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O + e<sup>-</sup>
<p>
[16] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub> + H<sup>.</sup><sub>ads</sub> ==&gt; H<sub>2</sub>
<p>
Van den Meerakker's mechanism is to some extent a "milestone" mechanism for electroless copper deposition that many researchers pay attention to, either to support, or, find fault.

<h3><em> <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> Mechanistic aspects of hydrogen absorption</em></h3>

Hydrogen can <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a32"> absorb</a> into the metal as:
<p>
[17] <img height="1" src="fig/clear.jpg" width="25"/> H<sub>ads</sub> ==&gt; H<sub>bulk</sub>
<p>
If care is not taken in the case of palladium deposits, for example, films can deform and crack from stress minutes after removal from the electroless solution, due to rapid removal of the <em>absorbed</em> hydrogen from the metal. This is a consequence of the well-known ability of palladium, including electroless palladium deposits, to <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#a32"> absorb</a> hydrogen to a level approaching a palladium to hydrogen ratio of 1:0.8 or greater, the high relatively high <a href="../../ed/dict.htm#d68"> diffusion coefficient</a> of hydrogen in palladium, and the relatively fast kinetics of the recombination reaction (Equation [16]) occurring at the palladium surface.
