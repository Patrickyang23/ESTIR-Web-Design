<h3> Transport processes </h3>
<p>
The use of dimensionless ratios to characterize the relative
importance of concurrent phenomena is widely practiced in
many fields of engineering. Dimensionless ratios also guide
scale-over between similar systems. Some of the most widely
used ratios have been assigned the names of early users such
as Reynolds, Schmidt, Nusselt, Sherwood, etc. In electrochemical
applications, where the focus is invariably on balancing
transport through the volume with reaction at the surface,
the key dimensionless ratio, the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p06"> polarization</a> parameter
that influences the <a href="art-d03-curr-distr.htm"><em> current density distribution</em></a> in well-stirred
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#e01"> cells</a>, was recognized independently by Wagner (1962) and by Agar and Hoar (1947).
<p>
Many of the more quantitative transport-centric electrochemical
engineering analyses can trace their roots to nonelectrochemical
treatments of transport phenomena,
including heat conduction, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d19"> diffusion</a> and reaction, and
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c66"> convective</a> processes near solid surfaces. By solving
transport equations with boundary conditions that describe
the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#k01"> kinetics</a> and energetics of surface reactions, one
obtains the variation of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e65"> potential</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a> throughout
the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e12"> electrolyte</a> as well as the
rate of reaction along the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a>
surface. However, the
equations and boundary conditions
are fully coupled throughout
the volume and surface, so
that progress was initially confined
to certain limiting cases
where the problem could be
cleaved into smaller pieces that
were more easily addressed.
<p>
In the literature through the
1960s, there were three categories
of boundary conditions, depending on the type of <a href="art-d03-curr-distr.htm"><em> current density distribution</em></a>,
for which the transport equations
could be simplified to
allow analytical treatment.
<p>
<ol>
<li><em>Primary distribution.</em> 
The <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e09"> electrode reaction</a> proceeds readily
but at low rates with the result that <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m31"> mass transport</a> and surface
reactions are not important in comparison with <a href="../ed/dict.htm#o19"> ohmic
resistance</a>. The potential field is obtained by solving the
Laplace equation, and the potential field depends solely upon
cell geometry.
<p>
<li><em>Secondary distribution.</em>
The electrode reaction is sluggish
but proceeds at low rates where mass transport is facile. The
potential field is obtained by solving the Laplace equation
with boundary conditions that describe the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c23"> charge transfer
overpotential</a>. The potential field depends on <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c67"> charge transfer
resistance</a>, electrolyte <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c48"> conductivity</a> and cell geometry. The
"Wagner Number" determines the uniformity of the current
distribution along the electrode surface.
<p>
<li><em>Tertiary distribution.</em>
The electrode reaction occurs under
mass transport limitations, and the current distribution is
determined by the laws of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c66"> convective</a> diffusion. Two cases
were typically explored since they permitted separation of the
potential field from the concentration field: (a) binary electrolyte,
and (b) excess <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s03"> supporting electrolyte</a>.
</li></p></li></p></li></ol>
<p>
During the 1960s, the digital computer came into use for
obtaining the <a href="art-d03-curr-distr.htm"><em> current distribution</em></a> in one-dimensional <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p22"> porous electrodes</a>
and led to a rich variety of treatments that spanned the intermediate
regions between the foregoing three limiting cases.
In addition, numerical methods were used for analysis of two-dimensional
potential-field problems.
<p>
The <a href="../ed/dict.htm#l09"> limiting-current</a> method for measuring the electrochemical
transport rate played a significant role in the
advancement of the engineering field. The limiting current
is the maximum <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c14"> current</a> that can be generated by a given
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#e09"> electrode reaction</a> for a given bulk <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r17"> reactant</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a>
under steady hydrodynamic conditions. The technique is
widely used to establish mass transport correlations, to measure
the local solution velocity, measure <a href="../ed/dict.htm#d19"> diffusivity</a>, analyze for
reactant concentration, measure hydrodynamic shear stress,
and to characterize the structure of turbulent flow near solid
surfaces.
<p>
Building on these foundations, the development of
increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods using a
combination of analytical and numerical approaches was
accomplished in the 1970s. A particularly significant breakthrough
that triggered this period was the discovery of how to
couple two-dimensional laminar boundary layer transport
with two-dimensional potential fields by collapsing both
equations into surface integrals which were matched by
numerical iteration on a rate equation. The use of this technique
for treating the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r30"> rotating-disk electrode</a> was a particularly
significant development.
<p>
By the 1980s the increase in
digital computing power led to
broadening of capabilities and
to development of finite-difference
and finite-element techniques
that have become steadily
more sophisticated and more
user friendly, moving from the
research lab into commercial
software that finds wide use for
engineering design. In addition,
emphasis on improved efficiency
of large-scale <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e02"> electrolytic
processes</a> and rapid growth in
microelectronic applications led
to significant improvements in electrochemical engineering
skills associated with multi-phase flow and mass transport in
high rate systems and at irregularly shaped electrodes.
<p>
Mathematical modeling of electrochemical systems at the
continuum level has advanced steadily over a period of four
decades. A wide variety of phenomena can be included with
the result that models are widely used for sorting out competing
effects, resolving experimental data, articulating scientific
hypotheses of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r15"> mechanism</a>, measuring system parameters,
and predicting behavior. Such models provide a rational basis
for engineering design, optimization, and control. Generally,
however, they are based on empirical characterization of the
interfacial processes that appear as boundary conditions in
the transport analyses.
<p>
<h3> Reaction processes at surfaces </h3>
<p>
While the foregoing events were taking place, concurrent
research efforts at the surface had, by the 1990s, moved down
to the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m34"> molecular</a> scale where they are now leading to new discoveries,
devices and process inventions. These advances are
driving the engineering community today in the need to
develop multi-scale simulation tools that bridge both continuum
and non-continuum phenomena.
<p>
The early literature on primary <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e65"> potential</a> distribution phenomena
employed the simplest possible boundary condition:
the potential was a constant on an <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e20"> electrode</a> surface. Most
analyses of the secondary potential distribution used the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#l15"> linearized</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#b20"> Butler-Volmer equation</a> or the 
<a href="art-t01-tafel.htm"><em> Tafel equation</em></a> for the surface reaction rate. Tertiary
phenomena at the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#l09"> mass-transport-limiting current</a> used the
condition that the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r17"> reactant</a> <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c26"> concentration</a> was a constant
(zero). Increased complexity in description of surface reaction
processes grew rapidly in the 1960s when improved control of
experimental conditions was achieved through use of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p08"> potentiostatic</a>
power supplies.
<p>
The <a href="art-d03-curr-distr.htm"><em> distribution of current density</em></a> along an electrode surface,
which usually varies from place to place, can be measured
directly by segmenting the test electrode and measuring the
current to each while holding all segments at the same potential.
The technique was first implemented by recognizing the
value of elementary reactions (especially the ferricyanide and
acid copper sulfate systems) that gave highly reproducible
results, and was greatly enhanced by developments in electronic
circuitry, especially operational amplifiers.
<p>
Quantitative advances in the area of coupled
transport/reaction phenomena, such as <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e152"> ac-impedance spectroscopy</a>,
came initially from the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e37"> electroanalytical</a> area and
from one-dimensional <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p22"> porous electrode</a> applications, and later with the
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#r30"> rotating-disk electrode</a> and also <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m38"> microelectrodes</a> for fast reactions.
Such developments addressed <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e30"> double-layer</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#a28"> adsorption</a>
phenomena as well as coupled <a href="../ed/dict.htm#h11"> heterogeneous</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#h12"> homogeneous</a>
reactions on metal and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s73"> semiconductor</a> electrodes.
These events facilitated discoveries such as <a href="art-c05-condpol.htm"><em> conducting polymers</em></a>,
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c102"> chemically modified surfaces</a>, sub-monolayer surface
films, <a href="../ed/dict.htm#p40"> passive oxide layers</a>, adsorbed <a href="art-i01-inhibitors.htm"><em> inhibitors</em></a>, surface salt
films, and others. The situation also led to rapid improvement
in understanding of <a href="art-c02-corrosion.htm"><em> corrosion</em></a> processes.
<p>
Still more powerful experimental methods continued to be
developed for control and direct observation, including high
vacuum and ultra-clean surface preparations, surface spectroscopy,
and scanning methods for obtaining local information.
These methods paved the way for several decades by
probing the electrochemical interface at unprecedented levels
of resolution, thus shifting the focus of electrochemical science
to small spatial scales ranging from the wavelength of
light down to the molecular
scale. These events
are leading to discoveries
and new technological
applications where
control of events at the
small scale is critical to
product quality.
Noteworthy among all
such techniques has
been the invention and
rapid development of
scanning tunneling and
atomic force microscopies
for the observation
of electrochemical
surfaces. The methods
are by now generating
images of such high
quality and quantitative
precision as to be stimulating new theoretical efforts in
understanding non-continuum <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m34"> molecular</a> phenomena at the
fundamental level.
<p>
Although simple <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e09"> electrode reactions</a> may be yielding to
molecular-scale theoretical analysis, characterization of multiple
simultaneous reactions still requires empirical and indirect
methods. Such situations are important in the <a href="art-e01-electroplat.htm"><em> deposition</em></a> 
of alloys or composites, in complex <a href="../ed/dict.htm#r15"> reaction mechanisms</a>, in
efficacy of additives, and in processes with low <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c15"> current efficiency</a>.
<p>
<h3> Implications for the future </h3>
<p>
Over the decades, engineers have moved into many
research areas that were initially explored by chemists and
physicists, such as <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c100"> catalysis</a>, polymers, fluid mechanics, and
transport phenomena, as well as numerous areas of electrochemistry.
Looking toward the future, it is reasonable to
anticipate that the same pattern will now occur at the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#m34"> molecular</a>
scale. Engineers are already developing new applications
in many promising fields. Because the role of the <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e65"> electrical
potential</a> is ubiquitous at the small scale, the electrochemical
engineering community has a natural position of advantage
in such endeavors.
<p>
There are many opportunities. Nanotechnology will be
increasingly used to synthesize novel materials including
functional materials (membranes and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s02"> separators</a>), hard materials
(<a href="../ed/dict.htm#c101">catalysts</a>), and soft materials (additives and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c102"> chemically
modified</a> surface films). By assembling <a href="../ed/dict.htm#n26"> nano</a>structured composites
(involving <a href="../ed/dict.htm#s73"> semiconductors</a>, <a href="art-c05-condpol.htm"><em> conducting polymers</em></a>,
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#r41"> redox mediators</a>, etc.) we will learn to manipulate pores with
significant <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e30"> double-layer</a> regions in order to achieve unique
properties. Engineering methods for exploiting double-layer
properties should grow in response to applications that use
control at small scales such as in <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e81"> electrophoretic</a> and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#o32"> osmotic</a>
flows, microfluidics in MEMS, and <a href="../ed/dict.htm#c116"> colloidal</a> and interfacial
phenomena. The role of the potential is central to biological
processes (nerves, sensing, membrane transport, cell fusion,
etc.) and technological applications will grow as engineers
merge qualitative biological insights with quantitative engineering
methods of analysis, many of which have been developed
in electrochemical applications during the past half century.
In the area of sustainability, many topics can be recognized
in the environmental area as well as in the greening of
the chemical process
industry (such as room
temperature <a href="../ed/dict.htm#i37"> ionic liquids</a>
for non-volatile
solvents).
<p>
To pursue such
opportunities, it will be
necessary to be vigorous
in the development of
"molecular engineering"
for electrochemical
technologies. We need
well-characterized systems
for developing
quantitative understanding
and predictive
tools at the small scale
where non-continuum
phenomena prevail.
The continued developing
of quantum mechanical computational methods will be fundamentally
important, but their use in engineering systems that
involve the charged solid-liquid interface will provide major
challenges for a decade or more. In the meantime, we need
accurate parameters to characterize molecular behavior.
Obtaining parameters for engineering analysis requires direct
<a href="../ed/dict.htm#n26"> nano</a>scale observations of <a href="../ed/dict.htm#e09"> electrode reactions</a> in various systems,
as well as data at different levels in the same system.
Improved experimental methodologies are needed for controlling
the interface in order to obtain high quality reproducible
data, which are essential for engineering characterization
of system behavior. The development of predictive tools
for engineering analysis of non-continuum interfacial systems
will open the door to linking with continuum macroscopic
simulations. What used to be called "boundary conditions"
will in the future be called something like "the
nanoscale region," a boundary layer within a boundary layer.
<p>
Many disciplines of science and engineering will be
involved in academic and industrial settings and in a global
context. It is essential to take strategic advantage of information
technology. Improved methods for discovery and innovation
by scientists and engineers need to follow the early
successes of e-commerce and the entertainment industry.
Collaborative environments are needed for linking codes,
data, and computing resources for use by scientists and engineers.
Experimentalists will use tools for deep analysis of data
libraries to extract parameter-estimation sensitivities and to
resolve competing hypotheses. Modelers will make their
efforts easier to use by others with approaches such as object-oriented
codes so that many can participate in testing scientific
hypotheses, parameters and engineering assumptions.
Legacy codes will become more accessible for design and synthesis.
Multi-scale simulations will become routine once
metadata schemas are developed to link continuum codes
with non-continuum codes. Security, authentication, authorization
and other measures will need to improve in order to
protect intellectual property associated with commercial
applications.
<p>
Continued emphasis on education in the electrochemical
field is essential as many new players in many disciplines will
require access to the electrochemical engineering approach to
inject molecular-scale understanding into electrochemical systems,
devices, and processes in a quantitative, systematic way.
The overarching lesson is that systems <em>can</em> be analyzed.
Scientific hypotheses and mythical explanations need to be
tested. Engineers need to develop and then use handholds for
testing preliminary ideas before investing major efforts in
analysis. Industrial investments in nanotechnology require the
trust and confidence that comes with well-engineered, high
quality products. Knowledge of the classical strategies pursued
with macroscopic tools during the past half-century offers
many insightful examples of how to proceed in the future
development of "molecular electrochemical engineering."
