                    Although there is some archaeological evidence 
                    which suggests that some form of a primitive 
                    <a href="art-b02-batt-nonr.html"><em> battery</em></a> (sometimes called a Baghdad battery) was 
                    used for <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> electroplating</em></a> in Mesopotamia ca. 200 BC, <a href="art-i02-introduction.html"><em> electrochemistry</em></a> as we know it today had its genesis 
                    in the pile of crowns of <a href="art-v01-volta.html"><em> Alessandro Volta</em></a> in 1800. The inspiration for his studies might have come from the 
                    famous frog leg experiments of Galvani, who, however, 
                    was content to conclude that the phenomenon was of 
                    biological origin. A metamorphosis took place with 
                    seminal contributions from John Daniell and Michael 
                    Faraday. From such humble beginnings, electrochemistry 
                    today has matured into a multidisciplinary branch of 
                    study. Built on the precision of physics and depth of

                        help overcome <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k01"> kinetic</a> limitations at low temperatures. Moreover, electrochemical processes can be tuned

<h3> Birth pangs </h3>
 

It was only in the sixteenth century 
that electricity began to be understood. 
The English scientist <b>William Gilbert</b> 
(1544-1603), known as the father of 
magnetism for his work on magnets, 
was among the first to experiment with 
electricity. He devised methods to produce 
as well as strengthen magnets. The first 
electric generator was constructed by the 
German physicist <b>Otto von Guericke</b> 
(1602-1686) in 1663. The device generated 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e139"> static electricity</a> by friction between a large 
sulfur ball and a pad. By the mid-1700s 
the French chemist <b>Charles Francois de 
Cisternay du Fay</b> (1698-1739) discovered 
two types of static electricity. He found 
that like <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charges</a> repel each other while 
the unlike charges attract. Moreover, he 
suggested that electricity consisted of two 
fluids: a vitreous form (from the Latin 
<i>vitrum</i> for glass) or positive electricity; and 
a resinous form or negative electricity. 
Later in the century, the two-fluid theory 
of electricity was opposed by the one-fluid 
theory of <b>Benjamin Franklin</b> (1706-1790). 
In 1781 <b>Charles-Augustin de 
Coulomb</b> (1736-1806) propounded the 
law of electrostatic attraction. <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c40"> Coulomb</a>, 
the unit of electrical charge, is named in his honor.

It was at this time, when insights into the new phenomenon 
of electricity were growing, that electrochemistry had its
birth pangs with the Italian physician and anatomist <b>Luigi 
Galvani</b> (1737-1798) proposing what he called animal
electricity. In a 1791 essay titled <i>De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu 
Musculari Commentarius</i>, Galvani proposed that animal tissue 
contained an unknown vital force, which activated nerves 
and muscles when touched with metal probes. According to 
Galvani, animal electricity was a new form of electricity in 
addition to the natural electricity produced by lightning (or 
by the <a href="art-f01-fish.html"><em> electric eel and torpedo ray</em></a>) and the artificial static 
electricity produced by friction. The idea of an animal electric 
fluid was rejected by Alessandro Volta, who argued that 
frogs legs responded to differences such as metal temper and 
composition. However, Galvani stood by his version and even 
demonstrated muscular action with two pieces of the same 
material. 
<p>
Interestingly, Galvanis experiments at the University of 
Bologna on the physiological action of electricity involved 
not only live frogs but also frog legs that had been detached 
from the body. He showed that muscle contractions in frogs 
and other animals could be triggered by an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electric current</a> from a <a href="art-c03-elchem-cap.html#leyden"><em> Leyden jar</em></a> or a rotating static electricity generator. 
The twitching of the frogs legs marked the experimental 
phenomenon that has come to be known as bioelectrogenesis. 
In fact, Galvanis experiments not only helped establish the 
basis for the biological study of neurophysiology, but also led 
to a conceptual change by acknowledging nerves as <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c50"> electrical conductors</a> rather than as mere water pipes, as held by the 
Descartes school. Galvanis name came to be associated
with galvanization (a technique of administering electric 
shocks, although another term, faradism, was also used for 
the technique). The word <a href="../../ed/dict.html#g15"> galvanizing</a> has shed this archaic meaning, and is applied at present to a protective treatment 
of steel with zinc. Galvani is also immortalized in the English 
word galvanize, which means to stir up sudden/abrupt action.

The credit for laying the cornerstone 
of modern electrochemistry must, 
however, go to <a href="art-v01-volta.html"><em><b>Alessandro Giuseppe 
Anastasio Volta</b></em></a> (1745-1827), 
a professor of natural philosophy 
at the University of Pavia, who showed 
in the early 1800s that animal tissue 
was not necessary for the generation 
of current. He argued that the frog legs 
used in Galvanis experiments served 
only as an electroscope and suggested 
that the true source of stimulation was 
the contact between dissimilar metals. 
He called the electricity thus produced metallic electricity. 
In fact through his voltaic piles, consisting of alternating 
discs of dissimilar metals, he effectively demonstrated the 
first <a href="art-b02-batt-nonr.html"><em> electrochemical battery</em></a>. The epochal invention formed the basis of modern batteries and a host of other galvanic phenomena including <a href="art-c02-corrosion.html"><em> corrosion</em></a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s65"> sacrificial anodes</a>. It also marked the first time that a continuous electric current was 
generated. Volta, whose work effectively rejected Galvanis 
animal electricity theory, coined the term galvanism. 
Napoleon Bonaparte honored Volta with the title of Count 
of Lombardy. Volta is also credited with the discovery and 
isolation of methane. Alessandro Volta is immortalized in the 
naming of the electrical unit <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v07">volt</a>, a nomenclature that dates back to 1881. 
<br clear="left"/>   <p>
Volta described his invention in a letter dated 20 March 
1800 to <b>Sir Joseph Banks</b> (1743-1820), then President of the 
Royal Society. It was titled On the Electricity Excited by the 
Mere Contact of Conducting Substances of Different Kinds. 
Banks showed the letter to <b>Anthony Carlisle</b> (1768-1842), a 
London surgeon. Enter chemist-engineer <b>William Nicholson</b> 
(1753-1815), a friend of Carlisle, and together they assembled 
a <a href="art-v01-volta.html"><em> voltaic pile</em></a>. In their attempt to determine the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charges</a> on the 
upper and lower plates with the help of an electroscope, they 
put drops of water on the uppermost disc (for better contact!), 
and to their surprise found bubbles of gas evolving. Soon they 
found that the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#t05"> batterys terminals</a> dipped in water <a href="../../ed/dict.html#w01"> generated hydrogen and oxygen</a>. They had discovered <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolysis</a> or chemical reaction driven by <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electric current</a>. 
<p>
Months later, <b>Johann Wilhelm Ritter</b> (1776-1810) 
improved upon the experiments of Carlisle and Nicholson and 
created a set-up to collect oxygen and hydrogen separately. 
Subsequently, he also invented the process of <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> electroplating</em></a>. In 
fact, Ritter might have made his discoveries earlier than Carlisle 
and Nicholson, but could not possibly have published the results 
because of his duties as an apothecary. Ritters observation of 
thermoelectric potential (the electrical potential at the junction 
of two dissimilar metals kept at different temperatures) in 1801 
also anticipated the 1821 discovery of thermoelectricity by 
the Estonian-German physicist <b>Thomas Johann Seebeck</b> 
(1770-1831). (Seebeck, however, failed to recognize that an electric current was 
generated when a bimetallic junction was heated. In fact, he used the term 
thermomagnetic current to describe his discovery. The Seebeck effect forms 
the basis of the thermocouple, which is among the most accurate devices for 
measuring temperature. The opposite phenomenon, the Peltier effect, which 
is the generation of a temperature difference brought about by a current in a 
circuit with two dissimilar metals, was observed a decade later.) Ritters experiments on the electrical excitation 
of muscles included subjecting himself to high <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltages</a>, which 
might have led to his early death. In this same time period, 
English physicist and chemist <b>Henry Cavendish</b> (1731-1810) 
made his famous quantitative experiments on the composition 
of water and also came out with a version of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o18"> Ohms law</a> 
for <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e13"> electrolyte solutions</a>. He is also known for the famous Cavendish experiment for the measurement of the density of 
the Earth. Not too comfortable with publicity, Cavendish lacked 
the acclaim that is due to a person of his scientific caliber. In 
fact, several of his findings were not published. For example, 
he recognized that the force between a pair of electrical charges 
is inversely proportional to the distance between them, the 
credit for which goes to the French physicist Coulomb. There 
are at least two physical structures that should recall him to the 
present generation: a square in London, named after him, and 
the Cavendish Physical Laboratory at Cambridge University.

The technique of <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> electroplating</em></a> 
was unveiled by Italian chemist <b>Luigi 
Brugnatelli</b> (1759-1828) in 1805. 
His experiments on gold plating were 
performed with a <a href="art-v01-volta.html"><em> voltaic pile</em></a> as the 
power source. Because he was rebuffed 
by Napoleon Bonaparte, Brugnatelli was 
forced to keep his results in low profile. 
Meanwhile, <b>William Hyde Wollaston</b> 
(1766-1828) and <b>Smithson Tennant</b> 
(1761-1815), in their attempt to use 
electrochemistry to purify platinum, 
ended up discovering other elements: 
palladium and rhodium (Wollaston) and 
iridium and osmium (Tennant). Drawing 
inspiration from Ritter, Carlisle, and 
Nicholson, <b>Sir Humphrey Davy</b> (1778-1829) 
used <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolysis</a> to isolate metals 
such as sodium, potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, and lithium. He concluded 
that electricity induced chemical action 
and that chemical combination occurred 
between oppositely charged substances.

A contemporary and rival of Davy, <b>Jons Jakob Berzelius</b> 
(1779-1848) also made important contributions to 
electrochemistry. Berzelius found that electrolysis resulted in 
the formation of elements at the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p54"> poles</a> of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e01"> cell</a>, which led 
him to suggest that <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> atoms</a> were charged and compounds were formed by <a href="../../ed/dict.html#n23"> neutralization</a> of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charges</a>. This was his dualism 
theory, which, however, did not apply to organic compounds. 
Berzelius also established the law of definite proportions. He 
is also credited with the discovery of several new elements 
including cerium, selenium, and thorium. It was he who 
created a logical system of symbols for elements (H, C, Ca, Cl, 
O, etc). With the work of Davy and Berzelius, chemistry was 
never to be the same again!

A momentous discovery was made in 
parallel by Danish natural philosopher 
<b>Hans Christian Orsted</b> (1777-1851), 
who observed the magnetic effect 
of electric current in 1820. <b>Andre-Marie Ampere</b> (1775-1836), who 
took the cue from Orsted, conducted 
extensive experiments and formulated 
his findings mathematically. Then 
came another formulation connecting 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltage</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a>, and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a> through <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o18">Ohms 
law</a>, the work of the German physicist <b>Georg Ohm</b> 
(1787-1854) in 1827. Ohms discovery was initially ridiculed 
by his contemporaries. However, by 1833 the fundamental 
importance of Ohms law in electrical circuit analysis was 
recognized and Ohm came to be considered the Mozart of 
electricity.

<b>Michael Faraday</b> (1791-1867) is 
considered to be one of the greatest 
scientists in history. Some refer to 
him as the greatest experimentalist 
ever, especially because his work on 
electricity found expression in day-to-day 
technology. <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f08"> Farad</a>, the unit of 
capacitance, and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f13"> Faraday constant</a>, 
are named after him. He invented 
the dynamo, predecessor to todays 
electric generator. His concept of 
lines of flux emanating from charged 
bodies and magnets provided a way to 
visualize <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e138"> electric</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m54"> magnetic fields</a>, and was crucial to the 
successful development of electromechanical devices, which 
dominated engineering and industry for the remainder of the 
19<sup>th</sup> century. The Faraday effect, a phenomenon he named 
diamagnetism, was also his discovery. In his work on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e139"> static electricity</a>, Faraday demonstrated that <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charge</a> resided only 
on the exterior of a charged <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c50"> conductor</a>, and that the exterior 
charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a 
conductor, a shielding effect we now use in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f20"> Faraday cage</a>. 
Faraday worked extensively in chemistry too, discovering 
substances such as benzene, 
liquefied gases such as chlorine, and proposed the system 
of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> oxidation</a> numbers. He also discovered the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f12"> laws of electrolysis</a>, by which he quantified electrochemistry, and 
popularized terminology such as <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a02"> anode</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathode</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a>, 
and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ion</a>, terms largely created by <b>William Whewell</b> (1794-1866). 
He rejected the traditional fluid theory of electricity 
and proposed that electricity was a form of force that passed

A major problem with the <a href="art-v01-volta.html"><em> Volta pile</em></a> 
was that it could not provide <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a> 
for a sustained period of time. In 1829 
<b>Antoine-Cesar Becquerel</b> (1788-1878) 
constructed a constant current 
cell, which was a forerunner of the 
well-known <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d07"> Daniell cell</a>. His <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a><a href="../../ed/dict.html#a19">alkali</a> 
cell could deliver current for an hour. 
Becquerels studies on <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> electrodeposition 
of metals </em></a> helped validate Faradays laws 
of electrolysis. The credit for solar cell 
technology must be given to Becquerel, 
who in 1839 showed that light impinging on an electrode 
immersed in a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c50"> conductive</a> solution would create an electric current. In 1830, <b>William Sturgeon</b> (1783-1850), another 
scientist who worked on sustained current generation, 
produced a <a href="art-b02-batt-nonr.html"><em> battery</em></a> with longer life than that of the Volta pile by 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#a40"> amalgamating</a> the zinc. Mercury was found to be a cure for 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#p06"> polarization</a>, a process by which a thin film of hydrogen bubbles formed over the positive electrode. The thin gas film 
led to high internal <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a> in the Volta pile, resulting in 
reduced current flow. In 1832 Sturgeon constructed an electric 
motor. The same year witnessed <b>Hippolyte Pixii</b> (1808-1835), 
a French instrument maker, build the first dynamo. 
Later, using Sturgeons commutator, Pixii built a direct current 
dynamo, which was the first practical mechanical generator 
of electric current.

In 1836, <b>John Frederic Daniell</b> 
(1790-1845) unveiled a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d07"> two-fluid battery</a>, 
which was the first battery to provide a 
constant and reliable source of current 
over a long period of time. Daniell 
used a copper vessel that served both 
as the positive <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p54"> pole</a> and the container. 
Inside the copper vessel was an earthen 
pot with a zinc rod (the negative pole) 
and dilute sulfuric <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a>. The copper 
vessel was then filled with a solution of 
copper sulfate. The porous pot served 
as a barrier, preventing mixing of the 
liquids. Although Daniell is famous for his invention of the 
two-fluid battery, he is less known for his 1820 invention of 
the dew-point hygrometer for the measurement of relative 
humidity.

The technique of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e26"> electroforming</a> was introduced in 1838 by <b>Boris Jakobi</b> (1801-1874). Jakobi applied his technique to 
the printing and coinage industries. Soon an electroforming

which was noted for depositing 107,984 <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k16"> kg</a> of copper and 720

<b>Sir William Robert Grove</b> (1811-1896) 
invented the first <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cell</em></a> in 
1839. Grove is also credited with the 
invention of the Groves nitric acid cell: 
zinc in dilute sulfuric acid as the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a02"> anode</a> 
and platinum in concentrated nitric acid 
as the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathode</a>, separated by a porous 
pot. Because the cell could sustain high 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a> output, it became a favorite with 
the early American telegraph industry. 
But it was replaced by the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d07"> Daniell cell</a> 
because of the poisonous nitric oxide it 
emitted and because of its inability to 
deliver currents at constant <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltage</a> (the voltage dropped as 
the cell discharged due to depletion of nitric acid). However, 
his invention of the gas voltaic battery, the forerunner of 
modern fuel cells, made him the father of fuel cells. In his 
experiments that led to the invention, he sought to reverse 
the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#w01"> electrolytic splitting of water</a>, to 
recombine hydrogen and oxygen 
to produce water and electricity. 
His background in law and science 
opened up the practice of patent and 
related laws. 
(A note: although the first fuel cell was constructed in 1839, the term fuel cell came into vogue only in 1889 with Ludwig Mond and Charles Langers attempt to build the first fuel cell using air and industrial coal gas as feed gases.)

In 1841, <b>Robert Wilhelm 
Eberhard Bunsen</b> (1811-1899) led 
the way for large scale exploitation of 
the Groves cell by replacing the expensive 
platinum with a carbon <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a>. The modified version was popularly known as the Bunsen 
battery. To students of science, the name Bunsen is associated 
with a burner, although the actual credit for the burner should 
go to a technician by name Peter Desaga of the University of 
Heidelburg. It must be pointed out that Bunsen fine-tuned the 
design of the burner to suit experiments in physics that he 
carried out with Gustav Kirchoff, a Prussian physicist. The two 
invented the Bunsen-Kirchoff spectroscope.

This was just about the time when the German chemist 
<b>Friedrich Wohler</b> (1800-1882) overthrew the vitalism theory 
that a vital force was necessary to make organic compounds by 
synthesizing urea from ammonium cyanate. <b>Adolf Wilhelm 
Hermann Kolbe</b> (1818-1884) also was another chemist 
who believed that organic compounds could be made from 
inorganic ones. He converted carbon disulfide, an inorganic 
compound into acetic <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a>, an organic compound, in several synthetic steps. Kolbe also made salicylic acid (the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction). Kolbe was the first to apply <a href="art-o01-org-ind.html"><em> electrolysis for organic synthesis</em></a>. He showed that electrolysis of carboxylic acids led to decarboxylation. Loss of carbon dioxide during 
the reaction led to dimerization of the resulting alkyl <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r36"> radicals</a> to symmetric compounds (Kolbe synthesis). 
<p>
During 1842 and 1843, <b>George Gabriel Stokes</b> 
(1819-1903) published a series of papers on the motion of 
incompressible fluids. They became fundamental to our 
understanding of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e13"> electrolyte solutions</a>. Sometime around 1845, 
in what was to mark a revolution in <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> industrial electroplating</em></a>, 
John Wright showed that potassium cyanide was a suitable 
medium for plating silver and gold. In 1857 electroplating was 
applied to costume jewelry, and soon electroplaters cashed in 
on a booming economical jewelry market. 
<p>
One of the foremost physicists of the nineteenth century, 
Prussian-born <b>Gustav Robert Georg Kirchoff</b> (1824-1887), 
formulated what are today known as <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k15"> Kirchoffs laws</a>. When he 
announced the laws in 1845, he was still a student, although 
in their final forms the laws became known only in 1854. The 
laws help in calculating the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltages</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> currents</a>, and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistances</a> 
in multi-loop electrical networks. The laws embody the 
principle of conservation of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charge</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e69"> energy</a>. In association 
with Robert Bunsen, Kirchoff introduced the spectroscopic 
method of chemical analysis, leading in the process to the 
discovery of cesium (1860) and rubidium (1861) as well as 
unfolding a new technique for discovery of new elements. 
<p>
<h3> Nineteenth century: the second half </h3> 

In 1853 <b>Johann Wilhelm Hittorf</b> (1824-1914), a 
German physicist, noticed that some <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ions</a> traveled more rapidly than others under an applied current. This finding led 
to the concept of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#t13"> transport number</a>. A couple of years later, <b>Adolph Fick</b> (1829-1901), at a mere 26 years, building on the 
Fouriers theory of heat equilibrium, developed a mathematical 
concept by which he showed that <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d19"> diffusion</a> is proportional 
to <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentration</a> gradient. That was in 1855. However, 
experimental proof of the concept was not established for the 
next 25 years. He was proficient in physiology, mathematics, 
and physics, and made another distinctive contribution in the 
form of a monograph entitled <i>Medical Physics</i>, in which he dealt 
with several topics including mixing of air in the lungs, heat 
economy of the body, physiology of muscular contraction, 
and circulation. Medical physics had 
to wait for nearly a century for another monumental book, 
which came through <b>Otto Glasser</b> (1894-1964). Cardiologists 
note that Fick made a distinctive contribution in 1870 when 
he described how mass balance could be used to measure 
cardiac output, thereby presenting a mathematical basis of 
physiological activity. 
<p>
Electrochemists connect the name <b>Josiah Latimer Clark</b> 
(1822-1898) with the standard Clark cell used for measuring 
the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e32"> standard electromotive force</a>. This English engineer was a very versatile inventor, known for his work on wireless 
telegraphy, particularly the Anglo-American Atlantic cable. It 
was Clark who introduced the notion of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v07"> volt</a> as the unit for 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltage</a>. In 1872, Clark invented the first standard cell with mercury and zinc <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a40"> amalgam</a> electrodes in a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s20"> saturated solution</a> of zinc sulfate. It had large temperature sensitivity, moreover, it was prone to cracking where the platinum lead entered the glass cell. Today, we use the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#w13"> Weston cadmium cell</a> as the standard for the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p04"> potentiometric</a> measurement of standard electromotive force. 
<p>
Between 1858 and 1860 the American inventor and 
industrialist <b>Isaak Adams, Jr.</b> (1836-1911) pioneered the 
technique of <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> nickel plating</em></a>, which immediately was exploited 
on a commercial scale. He was the son of Isaac Adams, Sr., 
the inventor of the Adams power press. Adams also had other 
credentials as an inventor: the vacuum-tube carbon burner 
incandescent electric bulb, which he invented in 1865, 14 
years prior to a similar invention by EdisonSwann; breech-loading 
rifles; and copper plating on steel for bonding rubber to steel.

The year 1859 witnessed an invention that was to revolutionize the 
world of portable power: the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#l01"> lead-acid battery</a> by the French physicist <b>Gaston Plante</b> (1834-1889). Plantes storage battery used lead plates as <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrodes</a> and delivered limited <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> currents</a> because the positive electrode had very little 
of active material. In 1881 <b>Camille Alphonse Faure</b> (1840-1898) replaced 
Plantes solid lead plate with a paste of lead oxide, which led to faster <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f19"> formation</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k01"> kinetics</a> and improved efficiency. The significance of Plantes 
invention can be gauged by the fact that the technology of 
the lead-acid battery has changed little since its invention 
except for changes in electrode design and casing materials, 
and that other battery chemistries are yet to approach the 
lead-acid battery in terms of certain electrical capabilities and 
economy.

Seven years later, in 1866, French scientist <b>Georges

pot containing manganese dioxide and carbon as the positive, 
and a zinc rod as the negative. The electrodes were immersed 
in an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte</a> of ammonium chloride. The Leclanche wet cell was the 
forerunner to the zinc-carbon dry cell which became the worlds first widely 
used primary power source. Leclanches cell was rendered dry by the German 
scientist <b>Carl Gassner</b> (1839-1882), when he cleverly configured the cell 
with zinc as a container and negative electrode. Gassner also employed zinc 
chloride in the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c03"> cathode</a> mix so as to reduce the wasteful <a href="art-c02-corrosion.html"><em> corrosion</em></a> of zinc 
during idling. The market for dry cells 
received a boost with the use of tungsten filament in flashlights in 1909.

<b>Gabriel Lippmann</b> (1845-1921) received the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1908/">
1908 Nobel 
Prize in Physics</a> for inventing the color photographic plate, 
but to electrochemists he is associated with the capillary 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e48"> electrometer</a>, which he invented in 1872. This instrument, based on the extreme sensitivity of mercury meniscus in a 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#c76"> capillary tube</a> to applied <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e65"> potential</a>, was subsequently exploited 
for measuring electrocardiograms. His versatility of interests 
can be noted in the fact that he was also the inventor of the 
coelostat (a long-exposure instrument that allows a region 
of the sky to be photographed by compensating for Earths 
movement) and conducted research in various areas including 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#p71"> piezoelectricity</a>, seismology, and induction in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a>-less circuits. Lippmann was a research advisor to Marie Curie and a professor to Pierre Curie. 
<p>
Between 1875 and 1879, the 
German physicist <b>Friedrich Wilhelm 
Georg Kohlrausch</b> (1840-1910) 
working with solutions of a variety of 
salts and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acids</a> developed the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k13"> law of 
independent migration of ions</a>. He was 
the first to apply <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a05"> alternating current</a> 
for electrochemical investigations. By 
using alternating current, he was able 
to avoid deposition of decomposition 
products on the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> surface and 
obtain results with high precision. 
Kohlrausch also demonstrated that <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i02"> ionic 
conductivity</a> increased with dilution. He was also noted for 
his work on autoionization of water, thermoelasticity, and 
thermal conduction and for his precision measurements of 
magnetic and electrical properties. 
<p>
The time was when the electricity was still in its infancy and 
the identification of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> electron</a> itself was to happen ten years 
later. At this time emerged a man who contrived to answer a 
question by Maxwell whether the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r23"> resistance</a> of a coil excited 
by an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> electric current</a> was affected by the presence of a magnet. 
<b>Edwin Herbert Hall</b> (1855-1938), an 
American physicist well ahead of his 
time, discovered what we call the Hall 
effect in 1879. The discovery remained 
a curiosity for nearly a century until the 
emergence of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s73"> semiconductors</a> that could 
produce significant Hall voltages. Today, 
Hall effect is used in the primary circuit 
of electronic ignition systems. 
<p>
This was also a momentous period for 
the growth of electrochemistry. 
The architect of this transformation was 
the American scientist <b>Josiah Willard 
Gibbs</b> (1839-1903). He was a true genius 
and drew on the concepts of great 
men like <b>Johannes Diderik van der 
Waals</b> (1837-1923) and drew accolades 
from peers such as Maxwell. 
Interestingly, Yale Universitys first 
doctoral degree for an engineering thesis 
was awarded to Gibbs. He also is known 
for his contributions to astronomy and 
electromagnetic theory.

The nature of electricity came in 
for much debate during this period. 
The British physicist <b>James Clerk 
Maxwell</b> (1839-1871) believed that 
electricity was the result of polarization 
of the ether or of the medium through 
which electric current flowed. However, 
in 1881 the German scientist <b>Hermann 
von Helmholtz</b> (1821-1894) basing 
his theory on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f12"> Faradays laws of electrolysis</a>, which relates the 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charge</a> to the amount of <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> metal deposition</em></a>, argued that the 
existence of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> atoms</a> implied the particulate nature of electricity. 
However, proof of the existence of such a particle (electrons) 
seemed to contradict Helmholtz theories of electrodynamics, 
which were based on the supposed properties of the ether. At 
any rate, the discovery of radio waves by <b>Heinrich Rudolf 
Hertz</b> (1857-1894), a student of Helmholtz, helped cement 
the theories of Faraday, Maxwell, and Helmholtz. Decades 
later, Albert Einsteins general and special theories of relativity 
helped dismantle the concept of the pervasive ether. 
<p>
Maxwells successor at Kings College, London, <b>William 
Grylls Adams</b> (1836-1915), along with his student, Richard 
Evans Day, found in 1876 that selenium upon exposure to 
light produced electricity, by a process we recognize today as 
<a href="art-p06-photoel.html"><em> photoelectric effect</em></a>. He thus became the 
first to demonstrate that light could be 
used to generate electricity without heat 
or moving parts. 
<p>
In his thesis published in 1884, 
Swedish physical chemist and the
<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/">
 1903 
Chemistry Nobel Prize</a> winner <b>Svante 
August Arrhenius</b> (1859-1927) 
suggested that dissolving <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolytes</a> 
in water resulted in varying degrees of 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#d21"> dissociation</a> of the electrolytes into <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ions</a>. 
The degree of dissociation depended 
not only on the nature of the electrolyte 
but also on its <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentration</a> - the 
greater the concentration, the lesser 
the dissociation. The concept of 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#a10"> activity coefficient</a>, a quantity that 
relates the actual number of ions at 
any concentration to their number 
upon high dilution, was born out of 
Arrheniuss studies. His collaboration 
with <b>Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann</b> 
(1844-1906) and <b>Jacobus Henricus 
vant Hoff</b> (1852-1911) led to theories 
on the properties of 
solutions. Latvian chemist <b>Friedrich 
Wilhelm Ostwald</b> (1853-1932), the 
<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1909/">
 1909 
Chemistry Nobel Prize</a> winner, extended 
Arrheniuss theory to the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c48"> electrical 
conductivity</a> and dissociation of organic 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acids</a>. Ostwald also propounded a theory 
of solutions based on ionic dissociation. 
In 1884 he came out with a definition 
of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c100"> catalysis</a>. Ostwald is also credited 
with the invention of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v11"> viscometer</a>. 
<p>
The application of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolysis</a> for 
winning aluminum from <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a27"> aqueous 
solutions</a> of aluminum salts ended up in 
the formation of aluminum hydroxide. 
However, in 1886 two young scientists, 
<b>Paul Louis Heroult</b> in France and 
<b>Charles Martin Hall</b> in the United 
States (both born in 1863 and died 
in 1914), working independently, 
succeeded in <a href="art-a01-al-prod.html"><em> producing aluminum by electrolysis</em></a> from 
a melt of aluminum oxide in cryolite. 
The inventions went through a patch 
of patent litigations before Heroult and 
Hall agreed to bury their differences. 
Their electrolytic process opened up a 
new world of industrial applications 
for rust-resistant aluminum, which was 
until then considered a prized metal 
used in fine jewelry. 
<p>
The theory of electrolytic 
dissociation formulated by Arrhenius 
inspired another architect of modern 
electrochemistry: the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1920/"> 1920 
Chemistry Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="art-n02-nernst.html"><b><em>Walther Hermann 
Nernst</em></b></a>
 (1864-1941). In 1888, Nernst 
came out with a theory connecting 
the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e32"> electromotive force</a> in an 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e01"> electrochemical cell</a> to the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e69"> energy</a> 
of the chemical reaction that produces 
the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a>. He also demonstrated that 
solvents with high <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d50"> dielectric constants</a> 
promoted the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ionization</a> of substances. 
His experiments with solutions led 
him to suggest conditions under which 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#s10"> solutes</a> precipitated from solutions. 
The theory of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s11"> solubility product</a> is 
also his making. He devised a method 
to measure dielectric constant and 
demonstrated that solvents with high 
dielectric constants facilitated ionization of substances. 
Students of physical chemistry know him through the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#n02"> Nernst equation</a>.

Tutored by Hermann Kolbe at Marburg and Robert Bunsen 
at Heidelberg, <b>Ludwig Mond</b> (1839-1909) became a well 
known chemist and industrialist. Initially, his interests were 
in the production of elemental sulfur, alkali, and ammonia. 
He also developed a process (the Mond process) for the 
generation of producer gas. In 1889, he and his assistant 
Carl Langer developed a hydrogenoxygen <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cell</em></a> with thin 
perforated platinum <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrodes</a>. Both Mond and Langer were 
instrumental in popularizing fuel cells. In their attempt to use 
coal gas as a fuel in fuel cells, they discovered the formation 
of nickel carbonyl (the molecules described by Lord Kelvin as 
metals with wings) from the carbon monoxide in the coal gas 
and the nickel in the electrode. This observation formed the 
basis of the Mond process for the extraction of nickel through 
a carbonyl route.

In 1890, inventive genius and businessman <b>Herbert 
Henry Dow</b> (1866-1930), best known for his work on 
halogen chemistry, developed an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolytic method</a> for 
the production of bromine from brine. Today, the method 
is known as the Dow process. An offshoot of this work was 
an <a href="art-b01-brine.html"><em> electrolytic production route for chlorine</em></a>. Slowly, and 
with the establishment of the Dow 
Chemical Company, he ventured into 
chlorine chemicals, organics, and later 
into magnesium metal and calcium. By 
capitalizing on the brine sourced from 
the ancient seas in the Midland region 
of the U.S., Dow opened avenues for 
mining sea resources.

The first to record a human 
electrocardiogram with the Lippmanns 
mercury capillary electrometer was 
<b>Augustus Desire Waller</b> (1856-1922), 
the French physiologist who 
in 1887 thought up the idea of 
using the body itself as an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c50"> electrical 
conductor</a>. (The first human electrocardiogram was recorded by <b>Alexander Muirhead</b> 
(1848-1920), but it was Waller who did it in a clinico-physiological 
setting. Moreover, Muirhead used a Thompson siphon recorder for his 
measurements while Waller used Lippmanns capillary electrometer.) 
<b>Willem Einthoven</b> 
(1860-1927) improved upon Wallers 
experiments and instrumentation. In 
1893, <b>Edward Weston</b> (1850-1936) 
developed a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#w13"> standard cell</a> that was to 
become the international standard 
for the calibration of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v06"> voltmeters</a>. The 
cell was less sensitive to temperature 
fluctuations than the previous standard, 
the Clark cell, and had the additional 
advantage of possessing a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v08"> voltage</a> very 
close to one <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v07"> volt</a>: 1.0183 <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v09"> V</a>.

This was also a period that witnessed 
as many as 1,093 inventions by a single 
person, <b>Thomas Alva Edison</b> (1847-1931), 
nicknamed the Wizard of Menlo 
Park. Although he is most popular for 
inventing the incandescent bulb and 
the phonograph, his unveiling of the 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#n34"> nickeliron battery</a> was no less 
a contribution. Simultaneously, and 
independently of Edison, <b>Waldemar 
Jungner</b> (1869-1924) in Sweden 
patented the nickel-iron battery. In 1899 
Jungner replaced the iron <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> with the more efficient cadmium electrode resulting in the much used <a href="../../ed/dict.html#n29"> nickel-cadmium battery</a>. It is interesting to note that in 1899 the 
world record for road speed was held by the electric vehicle! 
However, with rapid advancements in internal combustion 
engineering, the bottom fell off the electric vehicle market in 
the next three decades.

The year 1898 marked a turning 
point in organic electrochemistry with 
Swiss chemist <a href="art-t01-tafel.html"><em> <b>Julius Tafel</b> </em></a> (1862-1918) 
demonstrating the use of lead as 
an electrode for the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduction</a> of organic 
compounds. Tafel, who was both an 
organic chemist and a physical chemist, 
made seminal contributions to <a href="art-o01-org-ind.html"><em> organic 
electrochemistry</em></a> and established the 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#t01"> Tafel equation</a> connecting the rates 
of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e16"> electrochemical reactions</a> and 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#o07"> overpotential</a>. The Tafel equation was 
unique in that it could be applied 
to <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i10"> irreversible electrochemical reactions</a> that could not be 
described in other way. The several contributions 
he made in organic chemistry include <a href="../../ed/dict.html#o01"> reduction</a> with 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#a40"> amalgams</a> and the Tafel rearrangement. Tafel is also known 
for introducing the hydrogen <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c39"> coulometer</a>
for measurement of electrochemical reaction rates and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p74"> pre-electrolysis</a> as a 
method for purifying solutions. 
<br clear="left"/>   <p>
<h3> Twentieth century: first half </h3> 

Energetic considerations and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ionic</a> transport were 
the focus of this period. In one of the first approaches to 
characterizing <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a27"> aqueous solutions</a>, <b>H. Friedenthal</b> in 1904 
suggested the use of hydrogen ion <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c26"> concentrations</a>. In what is 
probably the beginning of the concept of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p13"> pH</a>, Friedenthal also 
found that the product of the concentrations of hydrogen 
ions and hydroxyl ions in aqueous solutions was always the same. It must be pointed out, however, that the concept of 
<i>pondus hydrogenii</i>, or pH, itself was introduced five years later 
by the Danish chemist <b>Soren Peder Lauritz Sorensen</b> 
(1868-1939).
<p>
In what was to mark the beginning of bioelectrochemistry, 
<b>Julius Bernstein</b> (1839-1917), of the University of Berlin, 
demonstrated that the action electric potential in nerves 
was the result of a change in ionic properties of the nerve 
membrane. He proposed his membrane hypothesis in two 
parts, the first one in 1902 and the second in 1912. His theory 
was based on the work of Helmholtz and <b>Du Bois-Reymond</b> 
(1818-1896), the father of experimental electrophysiology. 
Bernsteins work on the propagation of nerve impulses and 
trans-membrane potential led to great interest in bioelectricity 
and in the theory of nerve action in particular. It is noteworthy 
that Bernsteins work was the last nail on animal electricity, 
and came at a time when electricity was trying to rid itself of 
the shadow of biology. 
<p>
In 1910, <b>Robert Andrews Millikan</b> (1868-1953) 
determined the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e135"> charge</a> on an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> electron</a> by his famous oil 
drop experiments. The following year, <b>Frederick George 
Donnan</b> (1870-1956) established the conditions for 
equilibrium between two <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e14"> electrolytic solutions</a> separated by a semi-permeable <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m01"> membrane</a>. Today, Donnans name is associated with both the nature of the equilibrium and the 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#d26"> potential across the membrane</a>.

Around 1922, Prague evolved into the Mecca of electrochemistry. On 
February 10 of that year, 
<a href="art-p03-polarography.html"><em> <b>Jaroslav Heyrovsky</b> </em></a> (1890-1967), sometimes 
called the father of <a href="art-a03-analytical.html"><em> electroanalytical chemistry</em></a>, recorded a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c78"> current-voltage 
curve</a> for a solution of sodium hydroxide using a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d22"> dropping mercury electrode</a> and 
ascribed the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c14"> current</a> jump between 1.9 and 2.0 <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v09"> V</a> to the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m02"> deposition</a> of sodium 
ions on mercury. This marked the beginning of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p10"> polarography</a>, which took 
roots in his early work with F. G. Donnan on the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e66"> electrode potential</a> of aluminum, leading Heyrovsky into work on 
liquid electrodes that provide a continuously renewable 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a> surface. Later, he teamed up with <b>Masuzo Shikata</b> 
(1895-1964) and designed the first recording polarograph. In 
1959, Heyrovsky was awarded the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1959/">
Chemistry Nobel Prize</a> for his seminal 
work on this <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e37"> electroanalytical</a> technique. Polarography led 
to a spurt in the growth of the theory of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e16"> electrochemical 
reactions</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#m31"> mass transport</a> in <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e13"> electrolyte solutions</a>, and laid 
the fundamentals of all <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v04"> voltammetric</a> methods employed in 
electroanalysis. In 1929, Heyrovsky along with Emil Votocek 
of the Prague Technical University, founded the journal, 
<i>Collection of Czechoslovak Chemical Communications</i>. Slovakian 
physical chemist and mathematical physicist <b>Dionyz 
Ilkovic</b> (1907-1980), a research assistant to Heyrovsky, was 
one of the co-founders of polarography. The basic equation of 
polarography, the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i36"> Ilkovic equation</a>, goes by his name.

Relationships between molecular structure and electrical 
properties were also beginning to be unraveled. In 1923, 
<b>Johannes Nicolaus Bronsted</b> (1879-1947) in Denmark 
and <b>Thomas Martin Lowry</b> (1874-1936) in England 
propounded, independently of each other, a theory on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acids</a> 
and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b07"> bases</a>. According to them, an acid was a compound with 
a tendency to donate a <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a33"> proton</a> (or hydrogen ion), while a 
base was one that combined with a proton. The same year also witnessed 
Dutch-American physicist <b>Petrus Josephus Wilhelmus Debye</b>
(1884-1966) and German physicist and physical chemist <b>Erich Armand 
Arthur Joseph Huckel</b> (1896-1980) elucidating <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d67"> their fundamental theories</a> 
concerning the behavior of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s80"> strong electrolyte</a> solutions. According to 
them, electrolyte solutions deviate from ideal behavior due to ion-ion 
attractions. They suggested that <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i01"> ions</a> in solutions have a screening effect on the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e138"> electric field</a> from individual ions, which gave rise to 
the Debye length. Huckel is also famous for the Huckel rule 
for determining ring molecules and for the Huckel method 
of approximate molecular orbital calculations.
<p>
Debye won the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1936/"> 1936 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for his 
contributions to molecular structure, for <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d35"> dipole moment</a> 
relationships and for diffraction of X-rays and electrons in 
gases. In 1916, he showed that X-ray diffraction studies could 
be done with powder samples, eliminating in the process the 
need to prepare good crystals. This has come to be known as 
the DebyeScherrer X-ray diffraction method. The originality 
and extent of Debyes contributions are reflected in the many 
concepts that carry his name: the DebyeScherrer method 
of X-ray diffraction, DebyeHuckel theory, Debye theory of 
specific heat, DebyeSears effect in transparent liquids, Debye 
shielding distance, Debye temperature, Debye frequency, and 
the Debye theory of wave mechanics. He is also immortalized 
by the unit for dipole moment (debye), the Dipole 
Moment monument in Maastricht, and the American 
Chemical Society award in his name.

Around this time, <b>Alexander 
Naumovich Frumkin</b> (1895-1976), 
popularly known as the father of 
electrochemistry in Russia, made 
vital contributions to our knowledge 
of the fundamentals of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e09"> electrode 
reactions</a>  particularly the influence of 
the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a>-<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12">electrolyte</a> interface on 
the rate of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e04"> electron transfer</a> across it. 
Based on his studies on the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a28"> adsorption</a> 
of organic compounds on mercury, 
Frumkin proposed an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a56"> adsorption 
isotherm</a> that has come to be known 
as the Frumkin isotherm. He also 
introduced the concept of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p16"> potential 
of zero charge</a>. He joined hands with 
<b>Veniamin Grigorevich Levich</b> 
(1917-1987), an associate of theoretical 
physicist <b>Lev Davidovich Landau</b> 
(1908-1968), in relating his experimental 
results to theory. The collaboration led 
to the development of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r30"> rotating disc 
electrode</a> and to a quantitative analysis 
of the polarographic maximum. 
<br clear="left"/>   <p>
Electric traction received a boost with 
the invention of the so-called Drumm 
traction battery. This was a nickel-zinc 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#a19"> alkaline</a> battery invented by <b>James J. 
Drumm</b> (1897-1974) and it became 
popular with its use in a suburban train 
in Ireland. In 1932, <b>Francis Thomas 
Bacon</b> (1904-1992) introduced the 
use of an alkaline electrolyte and 
inexpensive nickel electrode in <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cells</em></a>. Twenty-seven years later, in 
1959, he demonstrated a practical five-<a href="../../ed/dict.html#k11">kilowatt</a> fuel cell. 
<p>
The quantitative measurement 
of <a href="art-c02-corrosion.html"><em> electrochemical corrosion</em></a> got 
established with a 1932 publication 
of <b>Thomas Percy Hoare</b> (1907-1978) 
and <b>Ulick Richardson Evans</b> 
(1889-1980). Evans described 
in the <i>Biographical Memoirs of Fellows 
of the Royal Society</i> as the father of 
the modern science of corrosion 
and protection of metals, laid the 
foundations of the electrochemical 
nature of corrosion. His 1937 book 
<i>Metallic Corrosion, Passivity, and Protection</i> 
is probably the most comprehensive 
book ever written by a single author 
on corrosion science. In 1933, in a 
paper on the oxygen electrode, Hoare 
showed how <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e29"> equilibrium potential</a> 
could be determined from <a href="../../ed/dict.html#t04"> Tafel plots</a>. 
Hoare was the first recipient of the U. 
R. Evans award (1976) of the Institution 
of Corrosion Science and Technology. 
<b>Herbert H. Uhlig</b> (1907-1993) was 
another champion of corrosion science. His <i>Corrosion Handbook</i> 
published in 1948 continues to serve 
generations of corrosion scientists and 
engineers even half a century after its 
publication.

Described by F. Mansfeld as an 
under-appreciated giant in the world 
of electrochemistry and corrosion, 
German electrochemist and materials 
scientist <b>Carl Wagner</b> (1901-1977) is 
also remembered as the father of solid

including tarnishing reactions, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c100"> catalysis</a>, photochemistry,
<a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cells</em></a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s73"> semiconductors</a>, and defect chemistry. Wagner
formulated in 1943 the mechanism of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i02"> ionic conduction</a> in
doped zirconia, which laid the foundations for the field of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i20"> solid

<b>Marcel Pourbaix</b> (1904-1998) had constructed his famous
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#p49"> potentialpH diagrams</a>, also called
Pourbaix diagrams. His work underpins
many aspects of <a href="art-c02-corrosion.html"><em> corrosion science</em></a>, <a href="art-m02-metals.html"><em> electrochemical refining</em></a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b01"> batteries</a>, <a href="art-e01-electroplat.html"><em> electrodeposition</em></a>,
and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e46"> electrocatalysis</a>. In 1952 he founded
the Commission of Electrochemistry
of the International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry, which in the
following year laid down the rules
that govern the signs of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e66"> electrode
potentials</a>.

<br clear="left"/>   <p>

Much of the theory behind <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c32"> cyclic
voltammetry</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e152"> electrochemical impedance spectroscopy</a> came from the work of the English electrochemist <b>John
Edward Brough Randles</b> (1912-1998). His 1947 work on
the cathode ray polarograph (oscillopolarograph) marked the
beginning of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#l04"> linear sweep voltammetry</a>, the solution to the
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#p75"> peak current</a> that comes through the famous RandlesSevcik
equation. (Sevcik was a Czech scientist, who along with
<b>Paul Delahay</b>, developed several instruments with triangular
sweeps. As an aside, it must be mentioned that it was Delahay
who in the 1950s introduced <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c37"> chronopotentiometry</a>.) The same
year (1947) Randles published an analysis of an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i33"> impedance circuit</a> containing <a href="../../ed/dict.html#d19"> diffusion</a> and interfacial <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e04"> electron transfer</a>,
which opened up a method to study fast electrode reactions.
Randles was not given to much publishing, but his papers lent
remarkable insights into the mechanism of electrochemical
processes. The equivalent circuit used in the analysis is known
as the Randles equivalent circuit, but in all fairness must be
termed the RandlesErshler circuit, for Dolin and Ershler had
published similar results in the Soviet Union in 1940, which,
however, were not easily available to the West due to the
raging Second World War.
<p>
Enter British engineer Francis Thomas Bacon. During his
years at C. A. Parsons &amp; Co., Ltd., an electrical company
based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he became the first to develop
a practical hydrogenair <a href="art-f03-fuel-cells.html"><em> fuel cell</em></a> and suggested its use in submarines. Unlike Groves cell, which used an <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12"> electrolyte</a>
and solid <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrodes</a>, Bacons fuel cell had a less corrosive <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b07"> basic</a>
electrolyte and pressurized <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p22"> porous gas-diffusion electrodes</a>. The first practical application of his technology was to come
years later in Apollo missions, which relied on fuel cells for
in-flight power, heating, and drinking water (a product of the
electrochemical reaction). It is interesting to note that Bacon
was the recipient of the first Grove medal in 1991.

<h3> Second half of the twentieth century and later </h3>

If energetics of electrochemical systems 
dominated the first half of the twentieth century, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k01"> kinetics</a> of electrochemical reactions began to be recognized as an 
important branch of theoretical electrochemistry in the 
second half. The credit for connecting electrochemistry and kinetics must go to English physical chemist <b>John Alfred Valentine Butler</b> (1899-1977). He, 
along with German surface chemist <b>Max Volmer</b> (1885-1965), 
and Hungarian physical chemist <b> Tibor Erdey-Gruz</b> 
(1902-1976), laid the seeds of the phenomenological basis 
of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e47"> electrochemical kinetics</a>. The <a href="../../ed/dict.html#b20"> Butler-Volmer equation</a> is a product of their contribution to theoretical electrochemistry. 
People in Berlin are familiar with Max-Volmer Institute at the 
Technical University of Berlin and the Max-Volmerstrasse. In 
1951, Butler teamed up with R. W. Gurney in introducing 
the concept of energy levels in electrochemical calculations. 
Butlers contributions to biochemistry are less well known, 
especially his work on the kinetics of enzyme action. Electrode 
kinetics also gained tremendously through the work of the 
German electrochemist <b>Klaus-Jurgen Vetter</b> (1916-1974), 
who made path-breaking interpretations of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e41"> exchange current density</a>, electrochemical reaction order, and the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#f18"> Flade potential</a>.

In the late 1950s, <a href="art-a03-analytical.html"><em> electroanalytical techniques</em></a> came of age with the study of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#h23"> hanging mercury drop electrode</a> 
by Polish chemist <b>Wiktor Kemula</b> (1902-1985), whose 
seminal work in electroanalytical chemistry led to extensive 
investigations in <a href="art-p03-polarography.html"><em> polarography</em></a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a40"> amalgam</a> electrochemistry, 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#s47"> stripping</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#v04"> voltammetry</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c32"> cyclic voltammetry</a>, and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e04"> electron transfer</a>. Dutch-American physical and analytical chemist <b>Izaak 
Maurits Kolthoff</b> (1927-1962), popularly known as the father of 
analytical chemistry helped transform analytical chemistry from an art with 
empirical recipes to an independent scientific discipline. Among his 
contributions to electroanalytical chemistry are <a href="../../ed/dict.html#c51"> conductometric</a> and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p04"> potentiometric</a> analysis, polarography for environmental trace metal analysis, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#i16"> ion-selective electrodes</a>, electron transfer and precipitation reactions, 
and chemistry of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#n18"> nonaqueous media</a>. He nurtured an edifice of analytical chemistry and a galaxy of students, which 
included such boldface names as <b>James J. Lingane</b> and 
<b>Herbert A. Laitinen</b>. The amalgamation of ideas and concepts 
from diverse areas such as energetics, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#k01"> kinetics</a>, 
stereochemistry, electrochemistry, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p13"> pH</a>, and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a18"> acid</a>-<a href="../../ed/dict.html#b07">base</a> reactions 
that Kolthoff brought into analytical chemistry was of such 
import that Lingane once said, ...analytical chemistry has 
never been served by a more original mind, nor a more 
prolific pen, than Kolthoffs. 
<p>
Parallel developments were also happening in 
electrochemical instrumentation, the most significant among 
them probably being the invention of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p08"> potentiostat</a> by the German engineer-physicist <b>Hans Wenking</b> (b. 1923). 
Basing the bulb amplifier, which he designed in 1952, as 
the core of his invention, Wenking made his contribution 
to electrochemistry through the potentiostat. Until 1957, 
his potentiostats were used at the Max Planck Institute 
at Gottingen for corrosion studies. Later, Wenking along 
with Gerhard Bank, began manufacture of the instrument. 
Potentiostats have come a long way in their circuitry, but 
the Wenking potentiostat remains a common trade name 
and serves electrochemistry in myriad ways: <a href="art-c02-corrosion.html"><em> corrosion measurement</em></a>, controlled <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e19"> electrolysis</a>, and electrochemical <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p40"> passivation</a>.

As Germany continued its 
contribution toward the growth 
of electrochemistry, there emerged 
another great name: <b>Heinz Gerischer</b> 
(1919-1994). The study of electrochemistry 
and <a href="art-p06-photoel.html"><em> photoelectrochemistry</em></a> 
at <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s73"> semiconductor</a> <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrodes</a> and the 
electrochemistry of excited states owe 
their origin to this genius. In 1960 and 
1961, he made a detailed mathematical 
analysis of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r03"> redox reactions</a> at metal and semiconductor electrodes, by which he showed that <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e04"> electron transfer</a> 
across the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e20"> electrode</a>-<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e12">electrolyte</a> interface occurred through 
tunneling. With a strong background in chemistry and 
physics, he toyed with several concepts, many of which were 
only beginning to be unraveled: the double-potential step (or 
a.c. modulation) to study very fast electrochemical reactions, 
interfacial electrochemistry, single crystal electrodes, and low 
energy electron diffraction [which his assistant <b>Gerhard Ertl</b> 
(b. 1936) pursued, Ertl received the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2007/">
2007 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>], ultra-high vacuums, and time-resolved 
spectroscopy. His work on electrode kinetics covered a lot of 
ground in the interpretation of the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r15"> mechanisms of electrode processes</a>. For example, he introduced the <a href="../../ed/dict.html#p30"> potentiostatic</a>
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#t23"> transient technique</a> for the study of reaction mechanisms.

Scientific research in the just-independent India of 
the 1950s was considered more of an oddity of human 
endeavor than a profession. But that did not deter Indian 
electrochemist <b>Kadarundalige Sitharama Gururaja 
Doss</b> (1906-1989) pioneering <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a41"> a.c.</a> effects on <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a28"> adsorption</a> 
and <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e47"> electrode kinetics</a>. He also introduced the techniques of tensammetry (independently of Breyer) and the redoxokinetic 
effect, now termed faradaic rectification. The impact 
of these techniques in adsorption 
studies, kinetics of fast reactions, and 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e37"> electroanalysis</a> of trace metals is well 
known. One of his illustrious proteges, 
<b>Sarukkai Krishnamachari 
Rangarajan</b> (1932-2008) was well 
known for his unified approach to 
modeling interfacial phenomena at 
the macro, molecular, and electronic 
levels.

This period also saw arguably the 
finest collaboration between a student 
and a teacher in electrochemistry, 
featuring <b>Brian Evans Conway</b> 
(1927-2005) and <b>John OMara 
Bockris</b> (b. 1923). They were 
instrumental in bringing electrochemistry 
from its moribund state 
of the Second World War era to 
modernity through their monumental 
multi-volume <i>Modern Aspects of 
Electrochemistry</i>. Incidentally, another 
student of Bockris, the Indian 
electrochemist <b>Amulya K. N. Reddy</b> 
also helped bring electrochemistry 
to the fore by compiling Bockriss 
lectures into <i>Modern Electrochemistry</i>, 
a two-volume book and arguably a 
classic. Bockris and Conway were 
the trail-blazers of electrode kinetics 
in the western world. Conway was 
a complete electrochemist in that 
he worked on nearly all aspects of 
electrochemistry: the electrified 
interface, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#s24"> ion solvation</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#a28"> adsorption</a>, 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e47"> electrode kinetics</a>, oxide film formation, 
<a href="../../ed/dict.html#e46"> electrocatalysis</a>, <a href="../../ed/dict.html#r01"> rechargeable batteries</a>, 
and <a href="art-c03-elchem-cap.html"><em> electrochemical capacitors</em></a>.

cell</em></a> (that has largely replaced the zinccarbon dry cells in flashlights) and the
key promoter of the RAM (rechargeable

This was also the time when quantum electrochemistry 
was taking roots with path-breaking investigations by
Georgian scientist <b>Revaz Dogonadze</b> (1931-1985). He was 
the first to recognize electron transfer processes as quantum 
mechanical transitions between two electronic states. 
His research group was the first to suggest a quantum mechanical 
model for proton transfer in polar solvents, which led 
formulation of a quantum mechanical theory of chemical, 
electrochemical, and biochemical processes in polar liquids. 
But it was <b>Rudolph Marcus</b> (b. 1923)
an American theoretical chemist, 
who put quantum electrochemistry on 
map. He won the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1992/"> 1992 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for his theory of <a href="../../ed/dict.html#e04"> electron transfer</a> in chemical systems.

Today electrochemistry looks
set to shift gears with parallel
advancements in materials science
and characterization techniques. For
example, there is increasing thrust
toward exploiting nanoscopic materials
and architectures. Expectations in
this direction are high because surface plays a key role in
electrochemical processes. Continual developments in the
synthesis and characterization of materials have also led to
welcome changes in electrochemical research. In closing,
we have made a chronological sequence of noteworthy
developments in <a href="art-i02-introduction.html"><em> electrochemistry</em></a> although this approach
might rob the interconnections between them. The scientists
who are portrayed as pillars of electrochemistry here have
either made seminal contributions or helped sprout what
were previously only just suggestions. We do hope that our
list is comprehensive; undoubtedly there are inadvertent
omissions. For these we apologize in advance and would
welcome comments.
