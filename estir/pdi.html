<b>EIS Spectrum Analyser (analysis and simulation of impedance spectra)</b>
</p><p>
EIS Spectrum Analyser is a standalone program for analysis and simulation of impedance spectra. The analyser routine is based on algorithms of the PDEIS spectrometer. In the original (potentiodynamic) version the equivalent circuit analysis is applied on a 3D spectrum and gives dependences of the ac response components on electrode potential. This standalone program has been adapted to solve a wide range of tasks in the common (stationary) impedance spectroscopy. In addition to data fitting to equivalent circuits with resistors, capacitors, inductors, constant phase, Warburg (3 types), user-defined and Gerischer elements, the EIS Spectrum Analyser provides various tests for data consistency and quality of fit. It has also a built-in impedance spectra simulation routine, tools for impedance data processing (subtraction of circuit elements and subcircuits, normalisation for electrode surface area) and plotting in various formats. The program is free for noncommercial use.

<b>Software package: Chemical reaction network toolbox (CRNT), Version 1.02</b>
</p><p>

        The Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox, Version 2.2 is now available
at the site: <a href="http://crnt.engineering.osu.edu/CRNTWin">
http://crnt.engineering.osu.edu/CRNTWin/</a>
</p><p>
There is no charge for the program. (It was developed as a suite of tools 
in connection with research sponsored in part by the United States National 
Science Foundation and the Petroleum Research Fund.) 
</p><p>
        The Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox (CRNT) is a program for IBM-
compatible personal computers. It does many, many things. People who use the 
program tell me that it's VERY easy to use and that they like it a lot. 
CRNT should be of interest to chemists, chemical engineers and mathemati-
cians at all levels of expertise (ranging from undergraduates to those 
engaged in very advanced research). I know that CRNT will provide chemical 
engineering students with lots of help with their kinetics homework! 
</p><p>
        The program consists of two parts, ChemLab and Network Analyst, that 
"talk to each other". ChemLab is the part of CRNT that will probably be of 
interest to most users, so I'll describe that first.  
</p><p>
        ChemLab is essentially a simulation environment. In response to a 
user-specified network of chemical reactions (and a user-specified 
assignment of rate constants), ChemLab will  generate the appropriate 
(isothermal mass action) system of ordinary differential equations governing 
the species concentrations. (These differential equations will generally be 
nonlinear and can be very complex.) In response to user-specified initial 
conditions, ChemLab will solve the differential equations and display the 
results in a variety of numerical and graphical formats. In particular, 
ChemLab will plot species concentrations vs. time and will draw two- and 
three-dimensional composition trajectories. ChemLab will also draw several 
trajectories simultaneously so that you can see two- and three-dimensional 
phase portraits.  
</p><p>
        Network Analyst, on the other hand, is somewhat more advanced. It 
implements certain results in chemical reaction network theory.  Chemical 
reaction network theory deals with the relationship between reaction net-
work structure and qualitative properties of the corresponding differential 
equations.  For example, in response to a user-specified reaction network, 
Network Analyst will try to determine if there can be rate constants such 
that the resulting differential equations admit composition oscillations, 
an unstable steady state, multiple steady states, a degenerate steady state 
(i.e., one with a zero eigenvalue), and so on.  When the Network Analyst 
determines that the answer is NO, it will tell you so. On the other hand, 
if Network Analyst determines, for example, that a reaction network has the 
capacity for multiple steady states, it will exhibit a sample set of 
rate constants along with a pair of steady states consistent with them. 
(The rate constants and the steady states can be exported to ChemLab for 
further study.) It should be mentioned in particular that Network Analyst 
provides powerful tools for mechanism discrimination in heterogeneous 
catalysis 
</p><p>
        CRNT comes with an on-screen tutorial and a help system that get 
you up and running pretty quickly. (Or so I'm told.) The tutorial was 
written primarily with chemical engineers and chemists in mind, but there's 
an appendix for mathematicians who want to understand how the differential 
equations come about. Again, ChemLab is probably the part of CRNT that will 
be of interest to most users, so it's probably best to concentrate on that 
first.  
</p><p>
       There are two files you'll want to retrieve via FTP: The first, 
CRNTPACK.TXT, is a text file that explains how to use the main file, 
CRNTPACK.EXE. (CRNTPACK.EXE is a compressed, self-extracting file that 
"unpacks" all the files that CRNT need to run properly.) Before retrieving 

CRNTPACK.TXT via FTP, the FTP mode should be ASCII (usually the default).  
Just before retrieving CRNTPACK.EXE, you should change the FTP mode to 
BINARY. This is done simply by entering BINARY at the FTP prompt. 
        Once the unpacking is finished, enter CRNT at the DOS prompt, and 
you'll be up and running. On your first time out, you should select "Hello, 
New User!" from the main menu. Have fun.

<b>Bibliographic list of review chapters relating to electrochemistry</b>
</p><p>
This compilation of review chapters on electrochemical science, engineering,
and technology is collected from multi-author advances/review books published
in English since 1950. Contributions from selected review journals are also
included. In all probability, these review chapters (and their reference
lists) contain all major advances made in electrochemistry during the last few
decades. Hopefully, this listing will provide a useful information source for
students and research workers of electrochemistry. The file contains more than
5,000 chapters. Search capabilities also exist.

<b>Waitfor v1.3: Cooperatively runs EG&amp;G programs</b>
</p><p>
For electochemists using EG&amp;G INSTRUMENTS software for EIS (M398)  and for 
conventional electrochemical measurements (M273). 
</p><p>
Waitfor v1.3 is a utility which enables automatic interchanging of runs of any
DOS programs in two different application-windows under Win3.1 or Win95.  
Designed for use in auto-execute sequences of M398 and M273 EG&amp;G Instruments 
electrochemical software. This program enables automatic interchanging runs of
auto-execute sequences of M273 (EG&amp;G Instruments program for conventional 
electrochemical measurements) and M398 (EG&amp;G Instruments program for impedance
measurements).
</p><p>
During operation, both programs are running in the back-ground. One program 
automatically detects the moment that the second program has finished and takes
over the control of the autoexecute sequence. For example, you can make a loop
for galvanostatical reduction for one hour, then potentiostatic EIS, then 
reduction again automatically for fifteen cycles. Especially useful in battery
related research.
</p><p>
This package also includes a MCONV utility which converts multiple EG&amp;G format
ASCII files produced by the run of auto-execute, to plain ASCII.  Also changes
*.00N type file names to *0N.dat type, if requested.
</p><p>
The package includes detailed description of the utility.
</p><p>
Special requirements: M398 and M273 EG&amp;G Instruments electrochemical software;
corresponding hardware for electrochemical/EIS 	measurements.

<b>ELSIM: Program for the simulation of electrochemical transient methods</b>
</p><p>

ELSIM version 3.0<br/>
               by Leslaw K. Bieniasz (June 1996)
</p><p>
The third version of the program ELSIM, for the simulation of electrochemical
transient methods, is now freely available for the purposes of scientific
research. Anyone willing to obtain a copy of the program is kindly requested to
contact me at the addresses indicated below (email preferred).
</p><p>
ELSIM is a User-Friendly Problem Solving Environment for the
simulation of transient electrochemical techniques. The program
    runs on IBM compatible personal computers  under MS DOS
 (including the DOS mode of the Windows 95 or IBM OS / 2 WARP
operating systems). The user simply types in an electrochemical
reaction mechanism and specifies parameter values.  The built-
in "reaction compiler"  automatically generates the text of the
      corresponding mathematical governing equations, and
   comprehensively  verifies the correctness of the reaction
mechanisms. If necessary or desired, the user may also directly
type in  the text of the mathematical problem definition, using
a conventional mathematical notation. In both cases the text of
the  equations  serves as input data to the formula translator
 that automatically generates a solution algorithm and sets up
                    the numerical problem.

</p><p>
                      The program solves:
</p><p>
(1)  Integral  equations for linear potential scan  and  cyclic
voltammetry, for electrochemical kinetic systems in  one  space
dimension (must be typed in directly). Choice of four  solution
methods.
</p><p>
(2)  Governing  equations independent of the space  coordinates
(sets  of  algebraic,  ordinary differential  or  differential-
algebraic  equations)  that arise for  electrochemical  kinetic
systems  characterized by the presence of  interfacial  species
(localized  at the electrodes) of variable concentrations,  and
possibly  bulk  species  (distributed in  the  electrolyte)  of
constant  concentrations. This permits i.a. the  simulation  of
adsorption phenomena coupled with electrochemical reactions  at
the  neglection of bulk transport, simulation  of  a  class  of
oscillatory electrochemical systems, or modelling of thin-layer
electrodes. Choice of two solution methods.
</p><p>
(3)  Governing equations in one space dimension, that arise for
electrochemical kinetic systems characterized by  the  presence

of   bulk  species  of  variable  concentrations  and  possibly
interfacial species of variable concentrations (sets of partial
differential equations for the concentrations of bulk  species,
optionally  coupled  with  the  sets  of  algebraic,   ordinary
differential  or  algebraic-differential  equations   for   the
concentrations of interfacial species). This permits  i.a.  the
simulation of homogeneous reaction-diffusion problems like many
frequently  discussed  CE, EC, ECE, etc.  models,  as  well  as
adsorption   phenomena   coupled   with   electrochemical   and
homogeneous  reactions,  in  the presence  of  bulk  transport.
Choice of eight solution methods.
</p><p>
   Virtually any kind of controlled-potential or controlled-
    current transients can be simulated, because the actual
      transient waveforms and other peculiarities of the
electrochemical problems can be freely defined by the users, by
          entering appropriate mathematical formulae.
</p><p>
A number of tools serving for the post-processing of simulation
  results and their comparisons with experimental data (e.g.
 fitting of the simulated transient curves) is integrated with
 ELSIM. The program involves a comprehensive context-sensitive
 hypertext "help" facility, and is accompanied by a  set of 68
example reaction mechanisms, a set of 70 demonstration examples
  of mathematical problem definitions, and a manual (over 250
pages). Extensive error diagnostics are present throughout the
                           program.
</p><p>
    Although in the case of complex kinetic models ELSIM 3.0
may suffer from various limitations inherent in the DOS system,
      this program is the most comprehensive and the  most
general of the currently available free and commercial programs

for  the  simulation of electrochemical transient methods,  for
           kinetic problems in one space dimension.
</p><p>

     In contrast to other available simulation programs,
            ELSIM has been widely described in
   regular scientific papers, so that the program users have
access to many details regarding the algorithms implemented in
  the program, properties of the simulation methods, various
  physico-chemical assumptions accepted, and other technical
 aspects. The following list of publications may be helpful in
                locating a subject of interest.

<b>Tto®: electrochemical data processing program</b>
</p><p>
The Tto program for treatment of electrochemical data begins to develop as a program only for voltammograms representation, because in our Research Laboratory we have many measuring equipment and each one uses a different data file. So that, if you wanted to compare data from different experiments, it was necessary to dump the data to treatment programs (Excel®, Origin®, SigmaPlot®, ...) by importing them, cleaning all the corresponding header and other additional information available in the file and taking into account the possible difference in the units used for potentials and currents in each type of file. 
</p><p>
To facilitate this work we create a program for graph representation (which was autoscale). It must automatically be in charge of the conversion of units, cleaning redundant or unnecessary data and delete headers or others that may be off interest. This seminal simple idea has been growing slowly towards a more powerful program that also allows processing of data contained in the experimental files
</p><p>
The program works with data from CAEM Instrumentation, Autolab, BAS, CH Instruments, Digisim, Varian, and TXT instrumentation.
