aa-readme-estir.txt                                     October 24, 2014.

Notes/information for someone who may want to continue to edit ESTIR and
related files once I am not able to do any more.

Practically all files in ESTIR and all related directories are plain text
(ascii) files, whatever the filename extension. There are only a few MSWord
(.doc) and MSExcel (.xls) files.

****************************************************************************

Some "things to do":

I typically search the web for relevant files to be included in the "inet.htm"
file several times a year. When I include a link to a site, I send an e-mail (if I can find an address) informing about the linking to the site, and I suggest that they may want to add a small logo to their site to indicate: "Listed in ESTIR". See "estir-logo-announce.txt" file.

I typically check every link included in the pages of ESTIR (except "grads",
see below) about once a year, they have a tendency to change or disappear.

I typically send e-mail to about one third of all professors listed in the
"Directory of Graduate Schools for Electrochemical Science and Engineering"
("grads.htm") every year for possible update of listing. That is, everyone
has a chance to update periodically (about once every three to four years).
See related files in this subdirectory.

There is something unusual here, this is the only file (gradst) where I keep a text version, exactly the same as the htm version. I use the renewal suggestion, and paste in the text version for the prof to see what to change.

The "aa-readme-estir" subdirectory contains 9 files in addition to this
(aa-readme-estir) one:


estir-logo-announce.txt   When I include a link in "inet.htm" to a site, I send
                          this e-mail (if I can find an address) informing about
                          the linking to the site, and I suggest that they may
                          want to add a small logo to their site to indicate:
                          "Listed in ESTIR". See "estir-logo.gif" in the "fig"
                          subdirectyory


grads-ann.txt       text of e-mail I send to people for possible listing in
                    the Graduate School Directory.

grads-rep.txt       reply to submission for Graduate School Directory.

grads-ms-rep.txt    reply to submission from MS granting schools.

grads-rev.txt       text of e-mail I send periodically (about every three
                    years to each address, unless the listing was updated
                    voluntarily) for possible update of listing. I send this
                    e-mail to about one third of all listings every year.
                    The year of original listing
                    and the years of updates are shown in a comment line at
                    the end of every listing. If the update request e-mail is
                    not returned and it is not answered, I assume that the
                    listing does not need updating and I consider it updated.

grads-rev-rep.txt   reply to update.

grads-review.xls    MS-Excel file of all update mailings and responses.

gradst.txt          text version of the graduate school directory


filelist.txt        this the list of files the “search would use. Note that there are no
                    no “html” files the search uses only ”htm” files. If ne sections are
                    added/deleted the file should be changed accordingly.

The "estir/grads index files" subdirectory contains files needed for generating
the index portions of the "grads.htm" file. See the "aa-readme" file in that
subdirectory for explanations.
