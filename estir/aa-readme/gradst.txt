Degree offered: Ph.D.in electrochemical engineering

Research interests: Zero gravity experiments to observe fundamental phenomenon
in the absence of induced flow. Electrochemical processes in industrial
electrolysis, batteries, and fuel cells are strongly coupled with transport. The
induced flow in the gravity field due to mass transformation (deposition,
dissolution, gas evolution, etc) at crystals, pores, or bubbles leads to a
macroscopic scale flow which influences the nucleation and growth processes.
With zero gravity experiments, the fundamental study of the ternary (electrode
material/liquid electrolyte/gaseous product) and the binary (liquid
electrolyte/solid product) phase situations is possible in the absence of all
convective transport to obtain kinetic parameters for processes in industrial
electrolysis, electro-deposition, corrosion, and batteries.

use, permitting the selectivities or detection limits required for real
applications. New strategies for the use of robust chemical sensors that excel
not only in the laboratory but withstand the harsh conditions of long term
monitoring, e.g., in the environment, in industrial process control, or upon
implantation into the human body. Fluorous chemistry. Synthesis of new
receptors. Development of new response models. Development of perfluoropolymeric
matrixes. Characterization of the physicochemical properties of receptors,
receptor-host complexes, and complete sensors.

Research interests: Method for preparation of electrodes consisting of atomic metal and polyaniline has been developed. In this case un-capped clusters of pure metals AuN , PdN and metal alloys AuNPdM (for N and M 0 to 8 atoms) are deposited in PANI, which serves as isolation matrix. The ionization energy of the clusters of such atomic size exhibits a characteristic “odd-even” variation in excess of 2eV for AuN, which is governed by the quantum mechanical pairing of free electrons in the metal. Electrooxidation of lower aliphatic alcohols in strongly alkaline medium, as well as infrared spectra of the composite follow the theoretical pattern and confirm the existence of atomic moieties. Every signal from a system in equilibrium is composed of the mean value and of the fluctuating component, popularly known as “noise”. The spectral analysis of noise, otherwise known as “noise or fluctuation analysis” yields information that is equivalent to that obtained from e.g. impedance spectroscopy. However, there is one important difference, which makes the noise analysis more powerful. The system under study does not have to be perturbed by an external stimulus, making it a true equilibrium measurement. Electrochemical applications of this approach will be discussed.

In general, introduction of magnetic microparticles onto an electrode surface
substantially increases current. These effects have been exploited to improve
proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells for higher power and higher carbon

Chemical and biosensors are multi-layered systems with specific chemistries in each layer.
The chemical composition combined with the material and surface properties of these layers
determine the performance characteristics of each sensor. Understanding the response
mechanism of the different sensors is the key for the development of novel sensing devices
which require only a few micro liters of sample, and can provide chemical information
faster, cheaper, with improved precision and accuracy, etc. A combination of state-of-the
art measurement techniques are used to decode and/or optimize the response function of the
sensors.

Degree offered: Ph.D. in chemistry and in neurobiology

Research interests: Microsensors and their use to measure chemical events in
microenvironments. Ultramicroelectrodes that are robust chemical sensors and
that can resolve chemical events with micron or submicron spatial resolution.
These probes can also be used for measurements at nanosecond time scales and in
solutions in which electrochemical measurements are normally impossible.  
Phenomena investigated: kinetics of electron transfer processes, chemical
communication between biological cells by substances known as
neurotransmitters, and the thermodynamics of redox reactions.
