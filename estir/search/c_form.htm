This compilation of review chapters on electrochemical science, engineering,
and technology is collected from multi-author advances/review books published
in English since 1950. Contributions from selected review journals are also
included. In all probability, these review chapters (and their reference
lists) contain all major advances made in electrochemistry during the last few
decades. Hopefully, this listing will provide a useful information source for
students and research workers of electrochemistry. The file contains more than 5,000 reviews.<br>
It is difficult not to miss some reviews in a compilation of this type, and it
is difficult not to make occasional mistakes. Additions and corrections are 
welcome, send them to: <a href="mailto:nagyz@email.unc.edu">nagyz@email.unc.edu</a>.

<p><hr><p>

Supply a search term. This can be a single word or a string (maximum four) of words. The search is case insensitive. Leading and trailing characters of the search term can be omitted. For example: you can search for "battery" or "batteries". To find both, you can search for "batter" (or even "atter"). You can search for "fuel cells" or "fuel cell", the latter will find both.
<p>
This type of search may give many unwanted results. For example, if you are looking for the metal "iron," you will also find "env<em>iron</em>ment." You can carry out an "exact" search to avoid this.
<p>
The whole chapter entry, not only the title, is searched. Therefore, you can search also for author(s). However, only the chapter entries are searched. If you wish to search for the "source book" by title, or the editor(s) of the book, use the <a href="http://electrochem.cwru.edu/estir/chap.htm"> browse</a> mode and the EDIT/FIND feature of your browser.
