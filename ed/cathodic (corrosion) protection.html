            <h2>cathodic (corrosion) protection</h2>
            
A <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a> protection technique whereby a structure to be protected is made the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a>. This can be achieved in two ways. In the "impressed-current" technique, a cathodic <a href="current.html">current</a> of sufficient magnitude is forced on the structure from a <a href="electrical source (supply).html">power source</a>. For example, an underground pipeline is connected to the negative terminal of a power source, while the positive terminal is connected to a nearby buried non-corroding <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a>. In the "sacrificial protection" (galvanic-anode) technique, the purposeful corrosion of a less desirable metal protects a preferred metal. For example, a steel structure can be protected in seawater by contacting with a piece of zinc. The zinc (the more <a href="active metal.html">active metal</a>) will become the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> and the steel (the more <a href="noble metal.html">noble metal</a>) the cathode of the resulting <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion cell</a>. Consequently, the zinc will be <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> while the steel will be protected (as long as the zinc lasts).
