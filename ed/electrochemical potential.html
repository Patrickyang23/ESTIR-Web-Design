            <h2>electrochemical potential</h2>
            
A concept used in the theory of <a href="electrolyte solution.html">electrolyte solutions</a> that combines the effects of both an <a href="electrical field.html">electrical field</a> on the <a href="ion.html">charged ion</a> and also the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of the ionic species in solution. Consequently, an "electrochemical potential difference" will inherently provide the driving force for both the <a href="charge transport.html">transport of charge</a> (<a href="electromigration.html">electromigration</a>) and the <a href="mass transport.html">transport of mass</a> (<a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a>) by an ion (an ion having both charge and mass will obviously transport both by its movement). A detailed discussion of this term would require a mathematical treatment. Not to be confused with <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a>.
