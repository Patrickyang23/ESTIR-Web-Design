            <h2>passivation potential</h2>
            
The most negative <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a> at which a <a href="passivation.html">passivating</a> film is formed electrochemically. It is equal to or more positive than the <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> of formation of the compound (usually oxide) constituting the passive film. Usually the <a href="current.html">current</a> goes through a maximum at the passivation potential during <a href="voltammetry.html">linear-sweep voltammetry</a>. Also called the "Flade" potential. See also an <a href="/encycl/art-c02-corrosion.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
