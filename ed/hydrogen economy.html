            <h2>hydrogen economy</h2>
            
A proposed, new <a href="energy.html">energy</a> distribution system based on hydrogen gas as the energy carrier and hopefully on a renewable energy supply. Hydrogen could be generated (using e.g., solar energy) in a variety of ways, one of them being <a href="water electrolysis.html">water electrolysis</a>. Hydrogen would be distributed to the end users through a system similar to today's gas pipelines. The hydrogen could be used either by burning to generate heat or by <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cells</a> to generate electricity.
