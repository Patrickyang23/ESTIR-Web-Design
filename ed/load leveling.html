            <h2>load leveling</h2>
            
An <a href="energy.html">energy</a> management system in which energy is produced even when there is no demand for it, and it is <a href="energy storage.html">stored</a>. This stored energy can later be released during high demand. This way the production capacity of the system can be less than the peak demand (load).
