A <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cell</a> that can be operated also as an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a>. This can be used essentially as a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a>. For example, it can be used to <a href="water electrolysis.html">electrolyze water</a> and store the electric power as the resultant hydrogen and oxygen gases. These can then be recombined during fuel cell opeartion to produce electric power.
