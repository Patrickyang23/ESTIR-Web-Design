            <h2>electroplating</h2>
            
The process that produces a thin, metallic coating on the surface on another metal (or any other <a href="conductor (electrical).html">conductor</a>, e.g., graphite). The metal substrate to be coated is made the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> where the <a href="cation.html">cations</a> of the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> are the positive <a href="ion.html">ions</a> of the metal to be coated on the surface. When a <a href="current.html">current</a> is applied, the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> occurring on the cathode is the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduction</a> of the metal ions to metal. E.g., gold ions can be <a href="discharging.html">discharged</a> form a gold solution to form a thin gold coating on a less expensive metal to produce "custome" jewelry. Similarly, chromium coating is often applied to steel surfaces to make them more "rust resistant". Electroplating is also used in the production of integrated circuits on computer chips and for other modern electronic instrumentation. The <a href="anode.html">anode</a> material can either be the metal to be deposited (in this case the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> is <a href="electrodissolution.html">electrodissolution</a> that continuously supplies the metal ions) or the anode can be of <a href="inert electrode.html">inert</a> material and the anodic reaction is <a href="oxygen evolution reaction.html">oxygen evolution</a> (in this case the plating solution is eventually depleted of metal ions). Also called "electrodeposition". See also an <a href="/encycl/art-e01-electroplat.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
