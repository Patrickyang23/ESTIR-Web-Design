            <h2>catalysis</h2>
            
The phenomenon of increasing the rate of a chemical reaction by a chemical present in the reaction medium (hogeneous catalysis), or by a solid surface on which the reaction can occur (heterogeneous catalysis). The catalyst itself is not consumed or transformed in any way during such reactions.
