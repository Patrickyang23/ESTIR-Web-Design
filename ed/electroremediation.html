            <h2>electroremediation</h2>
            
An <a href="electroosmosis.html">electroosmotic</a> process for removing soluble contaminants from soil. Electrosmosis is carried out in the wet soil with strategically placed <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a>, resulting in a movement of the contaminants toward the electrodes thereby cleansing the soil and concentrating the contaminants in a small volume of soil around the electrodes from where they can be easily removed. Also called "electrokinetic remediation", "electroosmotic remediation", "soil remediation", "electroreclamation", and "electrorestoration".
