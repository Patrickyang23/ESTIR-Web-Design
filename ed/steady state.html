            <h2>steady state</h2>
            
A state of a system in which the conditions do not change in time, or at least they do not seem to change with time. That is, the change occurs on a time scale longer than the time scale of the observations. A good example of the creation and slow vanishing of a steady-state condition is the <a href="liquid-junction potential.html">liquid-junction potential</a>.
