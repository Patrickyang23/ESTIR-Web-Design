            <h2>Helmholtz model of the double layer</h2>
            
The simplest model of the <a href="electrical double layer.html">electrical double layer</a>. The excess <a href="ion.html">ions</a> in the solution side of the double layer line up in one plane ("Helmholtz plane") very close to the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surface. In a somewhat more complex model there are two planes of closest approach of the ions. Ions in the "outer Helmholtz plane" are about two solvent-<a href="molecule.html">molecule</a> diameters away from the electrode surface because both the ions and the electrode surface are <a href="solvation.html">solvated</a>. Ions in the "inner Helmholtz plane" have shed their solvation layer (these are usually the weekly solvated, large <a href="anion.html">anions</a>) and penetrated the solvent layer on the electrode; these, so called <a href="contact adsorption.html">contact adsorbed</a>, ions are sitting directly on the electrode surface. The ionic portion of the Helmholtz model is often called the "Helmholtz layer" or "compact" or "inner" layer.
