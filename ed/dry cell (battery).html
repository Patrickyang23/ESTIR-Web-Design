            <h2>dry cell (battery)</h2>
            
An early name for the <a href="non-rechargeable battery.html">non-rechargeable battery</a> that is still used occasionally. The early non-rechargeable batteries were laboratory devices (see, e.g. the <a href="Daniell cell (battery).html">Daniell cell (battery))</a>. To produce a practical device, the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte solution</a> was "immobilized" by some gelling agent, and the whole cell was sealed to permit its use in any position. Hence the name: "dry cell". See also <a href="Leclanche cell (battery).html">Leclanche cell (battery)</a>. And an <a href="../encycl/art-b02-batt-nonr.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
