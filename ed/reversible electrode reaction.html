            <h2>reversible electrode reaction</h2>
            
A qualitative term for a fast <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a>. There are, unfortunately, several meanings attributed to the term "reversibility", resulting in possibly confusing situation. An electrode reaction is considered reversible in the "electrochemical sense" if the reaction is fast, that is, if the <a href="exchange current density.html">exchange current density</a> of the electrode reaction is large. In contrast, in the "chemical sense", reversibility indicates that the reaction can proceed both in forward and backward (reverse) direction. Also called <a href="nernstian reaction.html">nernstian reaction</a>. Opposite: <a href="irreversible electrode reaction.html">irreversible</a> electrode reaction. See also <a href="quasi-reversible electrode reaction.html">quasi-reversible</a> electrode reaction.
