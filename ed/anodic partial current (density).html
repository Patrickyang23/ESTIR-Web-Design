<h2><em><a name="a34">anodic (corrosion) protection</a></em></h2><p>
A process for <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a> protection of a metal or alloy achieved by impressing upon the metal an <a href="anode.html">anodic</a> <a href="current.html">current</a> of sufficient magnitude to cause the formation of a <a href="passivation.html">passive</a> film. Anodic protection is effective only for metals that are prone to passivate, such as stainless steel and titanium. See also an <a href="../encycl/art-c06-cathodic.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a> and <a href="cathodic (corrosion) protection.html">cathodic protection</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="a65">anodized (anodic) aluminum oxide</a></em></h2><p>
Porous aluminum oxide film produced by <a href="anodizing.html">anodizing</a>. Abbreviated as �AAO�.</p>
<h2><em><a name="a06">anodizing</a></em></h2><p>
A process to produce an oxide film or coating on metals and alloys by <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a>. The metal to be treated is made the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> and its surface is electrochemically <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a>. Anodization can improve certain surface properties, such as <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a> resistance, abrasion resistance, hardness, appearance, etc. One metal very often anodized is aluminum, all the above properties improve, furthermore, since the surface film is porous, the aluminum metal can even be colored by the application of pigments or dies in the pores. See also an <a href="../encycl/art-a02-anodizing.htm">Encyclopedia Article.</a></p>
<h2><em><a name="a37">anolyte</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> on the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> side of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> that is <a href="divided cell.html">divided</a> into compartments.</p>
<h2><em><a name="a27">aqueous solution</a></em></h2><p>
A solution with water as the solvent. Contrast with: <a href="non-aqueous solution.html">non-aqueous solution</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="a33">atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron)</a></em></h2><p>
The smallest physical unit of a <a href="element, chemical.html">chemical element</a> that can still retain all the physical and chemical properties of that element. Atoms combine to form <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a>, and they themselves contain several kinds of smaller particles. An atom has a dense central core (the nucleus) consisting of positively <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> particles (protons) and uncharged particles (neutrons). Negatively charged particles (electrons) are scattered in a relatively large space around this nucleus and move about it in orbital patterns at extremely high speeds. An atom contains the same number of protons as electrons and thus is electrically neutral (uncharged) and stable under most conditions.</p>
<h2><em><a name="a26">atomic weight</a></em></h2><p>
The average relative weight of a <a href="element, chemical.html">chemical element</a> as it occurs in nature referred to some element taken as a standard.</p>
<h2><em><a name="a45">autooxidation</a></em></h2><p>
See <a href="disproportionation.html">disproportionation</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="a07">auxiliary electrode</a></em></h2><p>
See <a href="counter electrode.html">counter electrode</a>. Abbreviated as "AE".</p>
