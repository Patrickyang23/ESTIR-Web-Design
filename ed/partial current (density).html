The two <a href="current density.html">current densities</a> at which the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> is proceeding in the <a href="anode.html">anodic</a> and <a href="cathode.html">cathodic</a> directions at an <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a>. The actual (net) current density is the algebraic sum of the two partial current densities (one is considered positive the other negative). <a href="electrode reaction.html">Electrode reactions</a> are typically "chemically" <a href="reversible electrode reaction.html">reversible</a>, that is, they can proceed both in forward and reverse direction. At <a href="equilibrium.html">equilibrium</a>, the reaction is proceeding at equal rate in both directions (see <a href="exchange current density.html">exchange current density</a>): the "anodic partial current density" and the "cathodic partial current density" are equal and the <a href="net current (density).html">net current density</a> is zero. When the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> is <a href="polarization.html">polarized</a>, the partial current densities are unequal and the net current density is not zero. If the electrode is negatively polarized, the cathodic reaction speeds up (compared with its rate at equilibrium), while the anodic reaction slows down and a net cathodic current density results (and vice versa for anodic polarization).
