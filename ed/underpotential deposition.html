The <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">electrodeposition</a> of a metal on a foreign metal at potentials less negative than the <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> of the deposition reaction. Such a process is energetically unfavorable and it can occur only because of a strong interaction between the two metals, with their interaction energy changing the overall energetics to favorable. Consequently, only one (very seldom two) monolayer can be deposited this way, and this is a very convenient way to produce well-controlled monolayer deposits. Abbreviated as "UPD".
