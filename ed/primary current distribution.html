            <h2>primary current distribution</h2>
            
A <a href="current distribution.html">current distribution</a> that is completely controlled by the <a href="resistivity (electrical).html">resistivity</a> of the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> solution between the <a href="working electrode.html">working</a> and <a href="counter electrode.html">counter</a> electrodes. The <a href="current.html">current</a> always follows the least resistive path; consequently, a non-uniform current distribution will result if the geometry of the electrodes is such that the resistivity of the current path is not the same to every point on the working electrode. Every other effect that may influence the current distribution is ignored in this case, or assumed to be negligible.
