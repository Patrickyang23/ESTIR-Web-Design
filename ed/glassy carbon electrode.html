            <h2>glassy carbon electrode</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> made of glassy (vitreous) carbon, a pure carbon with glass-like mechanical characteristics. It is resistive to many chemicals, it is impermeable to gases and liquids, has good <a href="conductivity (electrical).html">electrical conductivity</a>, low density, and high hardness. Also called "vitrous carbon electrode". Abbreviated as GCE. See an <a href="/encycl/art-c01-carbon.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
