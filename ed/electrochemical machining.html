A process to produce metallic objects with a technique that is essentially precision <a href="electrodissolution.html">electrodissolution</a>. The metal to be machined is made the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> while the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> (or "tool") is made of inert material and is machined to be the "mirror image" of the desired shape. A very small gap (typically, less than one <a href="mm.html">mm</a>) is maintained between the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> and a large <a href="current density.html">current density</a> is applied with a fast flowing <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a>. One of the advantages of this production technique is that very complicated shapes can be produced with a single operation from very hard alloys that would be very difficult, if not impossible, to machine with any other metal cutting technique. Some typical applications are the production of turbine blades and the drilling of holes with very large depth-to-diameter ratio. The <a href="cathode.html">cathodic</a> reaction is typically <a href="hydrogen evolution reaction.html">hydrogen evolution</a>. Abbreviated as "ECM".
