            <h2>Wien effect</h2>
            
The increase of the <a href="ionic mobility.html">mobility</a> of an <a href="ion.html">ion</a> in high <a href="electrical field.html">electrical field</a>. The mobility of an ion is somewhat decreased by the presence of the <a href="ionic atmosphere.html">ionic atmosphere</a> because the predominantly oppositely <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> ions surrounding the central ion will tend to hold it back. This effect is included in the normally measured mobility. However, when the ion is exposed to very high electrical field, it will move so fast that it will, in effect, leave behind its atmosphere which does not have time to reform, and the mobility of the ion (consequently the <a href="conductivity (electrical).html">electrical conductivity</a> of the solution) will increase.
