            <h2>atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron)</h2>
            
The smallest physical unit of a <a href="element, chemical.html">chemical element</a> that can still retain all the physical and chemical properties of that element. Atoms combine to form <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a>, and they themselves contain several kinds of smaller particles. An atom has a dense central core (the nucleus) consisting of positively <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> particles (protons) and uncharged particles (neutrons). Negatively charged particles (electrons) are scattered in a relatively large space around this nucleus and move about it in orbital patterns at extremely high speeds. An atom contains the same number of protons as electrons and thus is electrically neutral (uncharged) and stable under most conditions.
