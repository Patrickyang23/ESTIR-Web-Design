            <h2>oxidation/reduction</h2>
            
In a narrow sense, oxidation means the reaction of a substance with oxygen. Hydrogen can react with oxygen to be oxidized to water. Hydrocarbon fuels (gasoline, natural gas, etc) can react with oxygen to be oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Iron can react with oxygen to be oxidized to "rust". During oxidation, the oxygen itself is being reduced. Oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously.
