An electrochemical process that produces metals from their ores. Most metals occur in nature in <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> form in their ores. While numerous ways exist to <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduce</a> the ores, for many metals electrochemical reduction is the most practical. The ore is dissolved (often following some chemical purification or preprocessing) in an <a href="acid.html">acidic</a> <a href="aqueous solution.html">aqueous</a> solution or in a molten salt and the resulting <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte solution</a> is <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolyzed</a>. The metal is <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">deposited</a> on the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> (either in solid or in liquid form), while the <a href="anode.html">anodic</a> reaction is usually <a href="oxygen evolution reaction.html">oxygen evolution</a>. Copper and zinc are two metals that are often produced by aqueous electrolysis (see an <a href="/encycl/art-m02-metals.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>). Aluminum, magnesium, and sodium are some metals that can be produced by molten salt electrolysis. For aluminum, this is the only practically used production process (see an <a href="/encycl/art-a01-al-prod.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>). Also called "electroextraction" and "metal winning".
