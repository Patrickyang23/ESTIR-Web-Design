            <h2>overvoltage</h2>
            
The difference between the <a href="cell voltage.html">cell voltage</a> (with a <a href="current.html">current</a> flowing) and the <a href="open-circuit voltage.html">open-circuit voltage (ocv)</a>. The overvoltage represents the extra <a href="energy.html">energy</a> needed (an energy loss that appears as heat) to force the <a href="cell reaction.html">cell reaction</a> to proceed at a required rate. Consequently, the cell voltage of a <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a> (e.g., a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> during <a href="discharging.html">discharging</a>) is always less than its ocv, while the cell voltage of an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> (e.g., a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> during <a href="charging.html">charging</a>) is always more than its ocv. Occasionally also referred to as "polarization" of the cell.
