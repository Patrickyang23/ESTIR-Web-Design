            <h2>transport number</h2>
            
The fraction of the total <a href="current.html">current</a> carried in a solution by a given <a href="ion.html">ion</a>. Ions may carry drastically different portions of the total current if their <a href="ionic mobility.html">mobilities</a> are different. E.g., in a solution of sodium chloride, less than half of the current is carried by the positively <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> sodium <a href="cation.html">cations</a> and more than half is carried by the negatively charged chloride <a href="anion.html">anions</a> because the chloride ions are able to move faster (they have a larger ionic mobility). The transport numbers of the anion and the cation adds up to unity. As a matter of fact, the case when the ions move equally and the transport number of both ions is equal to 0.5 is a rarity. The <a href="Hittorf method.html">Hittorf method</a> is an experimental technique for the determination of the transport numbers. Also called "transference number".
