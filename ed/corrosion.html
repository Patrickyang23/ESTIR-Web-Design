            <h2>corrosion</h2>
            
A chemical (often electrochemical) process that destroys structural materials. Typically it refers to corrosion of metals, but any other material (e.g., plastic or <a href="semiconductor.html">semiconductor</a>) will also corrode. The simplest example of metallic corrosion is the rusting of iron in air. Iron is spontaneously <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> by the oxygen in air to iron oxides (while the oxygen is being <a href="oxygen reduction reaction.html">reduced</a>). Metallic corrosion is very often an electrochemical process. It is always electrochemical when the metal is immersed in a solution, but even in atmospheric corrosion a thin film of condensed moisture often covers the surface. The metal in the corrosive solution essentially acts as a <a href="short-circuit current.html">short-circuited</a> <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a>. Different areas of the surface act as <a href="anode.html">anode</a> and <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>, at the anodic areas the metal is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> to an oxide while at the cathodic areas the dissolved oxygen is being <a href="oxygen reduction reaction.html">reduced</a>. The spontaneous complementary oxidation/reduction processes of "rusting" are spatially separated while an electrical <a href="current.html">current</a> is flowing "internally" from one part of the corroding metal to another; the current is totally "wasted" as it produces no useful work but only generates heat. (A cell arrangement like this is often called a "local cell".)  See <a href="corrosion current (density).html">corrosion current</a> and <a href="corrosion potential.html">corrosion potential</a>.
