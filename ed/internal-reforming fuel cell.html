In some high-temperature <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cells</a>, the <a href="reforming.html">reforming</a> of natural fuels is integrated with the fuel cell. The <a href="catalysis.html">catalytic</a> conversion of natural fuels requires a considerable amount of heat and the heat evolving at high temperatures during the operation of the high-temperature fuel cell can be used for the reforming reaction, thus increasing the overall efficiency of the fuel utilization. Such units combining high-temperature fuel cells and reforming are called "internal-reforming fuel cells". Abbreviated as "IRFC".
