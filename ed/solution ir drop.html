            <h2>solution ir drop</h2>
            
The <a href="ir drop.html">ir drop</a> in the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> solution of a <a href="three-electrode cell.html">three-electrode cell</a> between the <a href="working electrode.html">working</a> and the <a href="reference electrode.html">reference</a> electrodes. This ir drop (which is expressed as a <a href="electrical potential.html">potential</a>) is always included in the measured <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a> of the working electrode. Therefore, it is important to minimize this error, and to place the reference electrode as close as possible to the working electrode (see <a href="Luggin tip (Luggin capillary) (Luggin probe).html">Luggin tip</a>). It is also called "ohmic overpotential (or polarization)" or "resistance overpotential (or polarization)". One can <a href="ir (drop) correction.html">correct</a> for the ir drop to obtain the real electrode potential, or in some cases one can <a href="ir (drop) compensation.html">compensate</a> for the ir drop during potential control. During the measurement of an <a href="electromotive force.html">electromotive force</a> (potential measurement without any <a href="current.html">current</a> flowing), the ir drop is always zero, and the position of the reference electrode is immaterial. See also <a href="ohmic loss.html">ohmic loss</a>.
