            <h2>redox reaction</h2>
            
A class of <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reactions</a> involving <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation/reduction</a> of two dissolved species. E.g., iron metal can exist in solution as a doubly positively <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> ("ferrous") <a href="ion.html">ion</a> or a triply positively charged ("ferric") ion. Such a system is often called a "redox couple", such as the "ferrous/ferric" couple. The ferric ions can be <a href="cathode.html">cathodically</a> reduced to ferrous ions, or the ferrous ions can be <a href="anode.html">anodically</a> oxidized to ferric ions. With these reactions, an <a href="inert electrode.html">inert electrode</a> is used that does not take part in any reactions under the conditions of the oxidation/reduction of the ions. This electrode then acts only as a source or sink of <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a>; examples are: carbon, graphite, platinum, gold. Compare with a <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">metal deposition/dissolution reaction</a> where one of the reacting species is a solid metal and the other species is in solution.
