            <h2>electroforming</h2>
            
A process to produce metallic objects with a technique that is essentially precision <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a>. The metal is deposited onto a "mandrel" or "former" of suitable shape to a desired thickness, followed by the removal of the mandrel to produce a free standing metal object. One of the advantages of this production technique is that very complicated shapes can be produced with a single operation. It is often used to produce very precise optical elements, and solid-state electronic devices (integrated circuit boards, computer chips). Other applications are the production of flat or perforated metal sheets, seamless perforated metal tubes, and metal bellows. Two very prominent past applications of this technique were the production of "stampers" for the old-fashioned musical (phonograph) records and "electrotypes" for the printing industry. Practically any metal or alloy that can be electroplated can also be used for electroforming. The preparation of the removable mandrel is an important step in this process. One example is the use of machined copper or brass that is surface treated to permit electroplating that will closely follow the mandrel surface but will not permit strong adhesion of the electroformed piece.
