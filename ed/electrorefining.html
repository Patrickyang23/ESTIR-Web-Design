An electrochemical process that produces a purified metal from a less pure metal. The metal to be purified is made the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> and it is <a href="electrodissolution.html">dissolved</a> by the application of a <a href="current.html">current</a> into a usually <a href="acid.html">acidic</a> <a href="aqueous solution.html">aqueous</a> <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> or a molten salt. At the same time, the pure metal is <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">deposited</a> on the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>. The process is carried out under conditions that most impurities will either precipitate as "sludge" or remain dissolved in the electrolyte. Copper is one metal that is often electrorefined in aqueous solutions (see an <a href="../encycl/art-m02-metals.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>), and aluminum is electrorefined using a molten salt electrolyte. Also called "electrolytic refining" and "metal refining".
