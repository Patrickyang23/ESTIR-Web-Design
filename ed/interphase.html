            <h2>interphase</h2>
            
The inhomogeneous spacial region at the interface between two bulk phases
in contact. The "interface" is a two-dimensional surface, while the "interphase" is a thin, but three-dimensional, volume. The physical/chemical properties in the interphase are significantly different from, but related to, the properties of the bulk phases. The interfacial properties usually vary in the direction perpendicular to the surface. An example of the interphase is the <a href="electrical double layer.html">electrical double layer</a>.
