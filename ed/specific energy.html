<h2><em><a name="s40">standard cell</a></em></h2><p>
A <a href="non-rechargeable battery.html">non-rechargeable cell (battery)</a> whose <a href="electromotive force.html">emf</a> is accurately known and remains sufficiently constant. It is not used any more because the availability of electronic voltage standards. See <a href="Weston cell.html">Weston cell</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="s13">standard electrode potential</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> of an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> when both the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized and the reduced</a> species are present in unit <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> (strictly speaking, <a href="activity.html">activity</a>) in the solution; if the "reduced" form is a metal, a pure metal (not alloyed with other metals) is considered to be at unit concentration. (See also the <a href="Nernst equation.html">Nernst equation</a>.) The standard potentials are always expressed against the <a href="standard hydrogen electrode.html">standard hydrogen electrode</a> the potential of which is zero "by definition". Standard potentials are a function of the temperature, they are usually tabulated for 25<sup>o</sup>C (77<sup>o</sup>F). Also called "normal electrode potential".</p>

The standard potential is the <a href="electromotive force.html">electromotive force</a> of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> comprised of the electrode in question and the standard hydrogen electrode. Strictly speaking, one must use unit <a href="activity.html">activities</a> rather than <a href="concentration.html">concentrations</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="s08">standard hydrogen electrode</a></em></h2><p>
The most fundamental <a href="reference electrode.html">reference electrode</a> in electrochemistry. "By definition" its <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> is considered zero at any temperature, because this electrode was chosen as an arbitrary zero point for <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potentials</a>. A zero point is needed since the potential of a single electrode cannot be measured, only the difference of two electrode potentials is measurable. All electrode potentials are expressed on this "hydrogen scale". It is a <a href="hydrogen electrode.html">hydrogen electrode</a> with an <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> containing unit <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of hydrogen <a href="ion.html">ions</a> and <a href="solubility.html">saturated</a> with hydrogen gas at unit atmosphere pressure. This electrode can be somewhat inconvenient to use because of the need to supply hydrogen gas. Therefore, other reference electrodes (e.g., <a href="calomel electrode.html">calomel</a> or <a href="silver_silver-chloride electrode.html">silver/silver chloride</a>) are often used instead, but the measured electrode potentials can be converted to the "hydrogen scale". Abbreviated as "SHE". Also called "normal hydrogen electrode".</p>

Strictly speaking, one must use unit <a href="activity.html">activity</a> rather than <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of hydrogen ions and unit <a href="fugacity.html">fugacity</a> rather than unit pressure of hydrogen gas.
