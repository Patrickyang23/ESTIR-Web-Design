An <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> that <a href="energy conversion.html">converts</a> <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a> into chemical <a href="energy.html">energy</a>. The chemical reactions do not occur "spontaneously" at the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> when they are connected through an external circuit. The reaction must be forced by applying an external electrical <a href="current.html">current</a>. It is used to <a href="energy storage.html">store</a> <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a> in chemical form, see <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a>. It is also used to decompose or produce (synthesize) new chemicals by application of <a href="electrical power.html">electrical power</a>. This process is called <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a>, e.g., <a href="water electrolysis.html">water can be decomposed</a> into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.
