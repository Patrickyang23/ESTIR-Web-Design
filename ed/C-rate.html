            <h2>C-rate</h2>
            
A <a href="charge rate.html">charge</a> or <a href="discharge rate.html">discharge current rate</a> of a <a href="battery.html">battery</a> expressed in <a href="ampere.html">amperes</a>. It is numerically a fraction or a multiple of the <a href="rated capacity.html">rated capacity</a> of the battery expressed in <a href="ampere-hour.html">ampere-hours</a>. For example: for a 5-Ah rated capacity battery, C-rate is 5 A; C/5-rate is one A; 2C-rate is 10 A; and so on.

<h2><em><a name="c24">crystallization overpotential (polarization)</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="overpotential.html">overpotential</a> (alternatively called <a href="polarization.html">polarization</a>) associated with the crystallization step in <a href="electrocrystallization.html">electrocrystallization</a>. The crystallization is an <a href="elementary reaction step.html">elementary step</a> in the overall <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="c14">current</a></em></h2><p>
The movement of <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charges</a> in a <a href="conductor (electrical).html">conductor;</a> carried by <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> in an <a href="electronic conductor.html">electronic conductor</a> (electronic current) or by <a href="ion.html">ions</a> in an <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionic conductor</a> (ionic current). "By definition" the electrical current always flows from the positive <a href="electrical potential.html">potential</a> end of the conductor toward the negative potential end, independent of the actual direction of motion of the differently charged current carrier (or "charge carrier") particles. Two kinds of currents must be distinguished: "direct current (dc)" and "alternating current (ac)". Direct current is the unidirectional continuous flow of current, while alternating current is the oscillating (back and forth) flow of current. In electrochemistry, we almost always use direct current. Consequently, the term "current" always designates "dc" in this dictionary unless specifically stated to be "ac". The normal household current is an alternating current. The measurement unit of current is the <a href="ampere.html">ampere</a>.</p>

As mentioned above, the "defined" current flows from the positive <a href="terminal.html">terminal</a> of the <a href="electrical source (supply).html">current source</a>, trough the <a href="load.html">load</a>, to the negative terminal of the source. Consequently, inside the "source" (whether it is electromechanical or electrochemical) the current must flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal since there must be a complete circuit. This concept is especially important in electrochemistry because an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> can be either a current "source" (<a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a>) or a "load" (<a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a>). Furthermore, a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> operates as a "source" during <a href="discharging.html">discharge</a> and as a "load" during <a href="charging.html">charge</a>.
