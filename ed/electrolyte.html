A chemical compound (salt, <a href="acid.html">acid</a>, or <a href="base.html">base</a>) that <a href="dissociation.html">dissociates</a> into <a href="electrical charge.html">electrically charged</a> <a href="ion.html">ions</a> when dissolved in a solvent. The resulting electrolyte (or electrolytic) solution is an <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionic conductor</a> of electricity. Very often, the so formed solution itself is simply called an "electrolyte". Also, molten salts and molten salt solutions are often called "electrolyte" when used in <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cells</a>, see <a href="ionic liquid.html">ionic liquid</a>.
