            <h2>potential-pH diagram</h2>
            
A diagram often used in the field of <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a> to indicate the corrosion tendency and stability of a metal in <a href="aqueous solution.html">aqueous solutions</a>. The <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> of the metal is plotted against the <a href="pH.html">pH</a> of the solution, usually for a series of <a href="concentration.html">concentrations</a> of the metal <a href="ion.html">ion</a>. The curves demarcate potential-pH domains where a species of the metal is predominant in equilibrium, this can be the metal, its ion, oxide, or hydroxide. In simplified version, the diagram can indicate the potential-pH domains where the metal is immune to corrosion, corrodes, or <a href="passivation.html">passivates</a>. The diagrams must be used with some caution because they represent equilibrium conditions and the corrosion tendency is also influenced by <a href="kinetics.html">kinetic</a> effects. Also called "Pourbaix diagram" and "E - pH diagram". See also an <a href="/encycl/art-c02-corrosion.htm#pourb">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
