            <h2>electrodeposition</h2>
            
A process for depositing solid materials on an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surface using <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a>. It is a somewhat loosely used term that is applied to many technologies. There are a number of <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">metal deposition</a> technologies. However, not only metals but also different compounds can be electrodeposited. This is used most often for the formation of oxides (such as manganese dioxide and lead dioxide) by <a href="anode.html">anodic</a> <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation</a> of dissolved salts. Deposition can also be achieved <a href="electrophoretic deposition (painting).html">electrophoreticly</a>.
