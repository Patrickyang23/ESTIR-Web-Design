            <h2>electrochemical impedance spectroscopy</h2>
            
Electrochemical <a href="impedance.html">impedance</a> spectroscopy is a powerful tool for examining processes occurring at <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surfaces. A small amplitude <a href="ac.html">ac</a> (sinusoidal) excitation signal (<a href="electrical potential.html">potential</a> or <a href="current.html">current</a>), covering a wide range of <a href="frequency.html">frequencies</a>, is applied to the system under investigation and the response (current or voltage or another signal of interest) is measured. Due to the small amplitude of the excitation signal, the measurement can be carried out without significantly disturbing the properties being measured. Due to the wide range of frequencies used, the complex sequence of coupled processes such as, <a href="electron-transfer reaction.html">electron transfer</a>, <a href="mass transport.html">mass transport</a>, chemical reaction, etc. can often be separated and investigated with a single measurement. It is routinely used in <a href="electrode kinetics.html">electrode kinetics</a> and <a href="(electrode) reaction mechanism.html">mechanism</a> investigations, and in the characterization of <a href="battery.html">batteries</a>, <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cells</a>, and <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a> phenomena. Abbreviated as "EIS".
