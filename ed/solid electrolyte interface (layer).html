            <h2>solid electrolyte interface (layer)</h2>
            
A <a href="passivation.html">passivating</a> type layer formed on lithium in contact both with liquid and polymer <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolytes</a> when used as the negative <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> in a <a href="battery.html">battery</a>.
It is generally considered that this layer makes the practical <a href="lithium battery.html">lithium batteries</a> possible because lithium itself is too reactive to be stable in contact with the electrolytes. This layer acts as an interface between the metal and the solution and has the properties of a <a href="solid electrolyte.html">solid electrolyte</a>. Abbreviated as "SEI".
