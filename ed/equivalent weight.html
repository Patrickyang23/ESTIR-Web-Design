            <h2>equivalent weight</h2>
            
A characteristic weight of a substance relating to a specific reaction the substance participates. In <a href="electrochemical reaction.html">electrochemical reactions</a>, the <a href="molecular weight.html">molecular weight</a> or <a href="atomic weight.html">atomic weight</a> divided by the number of <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> transferred during the reaction. Consequently, the equivalent weight of a substance can be different for different reactions. E.g. the equivalent weight of the cuprous <a href="ion.html">ion</a> (singly <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> copper ion) is equal to its atomic weight, independently whether it is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> to cupric ion (doubly charged copper ion) or it is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduced</a> to (electrically <a href="neutralization.html">neutral</a>) copper metal. On the other hand, the equivalent weight of the cupric ion is one half of its atomic weight if it is reduced to copper metal, but it is the atomic weight if it is reduced only to cuprous ion.
