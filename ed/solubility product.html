            <h2>solubility product</h2>
            

The <a href="solubility.html">solubility</a> of slightly soluble salts is often expressed as the product of the solubility <a href="concentration.html">concentrations</a> of its <a href="ion.html">ions</a>. E.g., the solubility product of silver chloride is the product of the concentrations of the silver and chloride ions in the saturated solution of this salt. The significance of the solubility product is that its value cannot be exceeded even in the presence of other dissolved salts. Consequently, the solubility of silver chloride is less in a solution containing potassium chloride than in pure water. This is because in the calculation of the solubility product one must use the "total" chloride concentration in the solution, therefore a silver concentration lower than in water is needed to satisfy a constant solubility product.
