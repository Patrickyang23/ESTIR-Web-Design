            <h2>hydrogen electrode</h2>
            
A <a href="redox electrode.html">redox electrode</a> with dissolved hydrogen gas being the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduced</a> species and hydrogen <a href="ion.html">ions</a> the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> species. Hydrogen gas (or a gas mixture containing hydrogen) is bubbled through the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> to keep a desired dissolved hydrogen content. The inert metallic electrode is usually <a href="platinized platinum electrode.html">platinized platinum</a>. The <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> of this electrode depends on the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> (strictly speaking, <a href="activity.html">activity</a>) of both the hydrogen <a href="ion.html">ions</a> and the dissolved hydrogen gas (controlled by the hydrogen gas pressure), see <a href="Nernst equation.html">Nernst equation</a>. The electrode can be used as a <a href="working electrode.html"> measuring electrode</a> in a sensor to determine the hydrogen ion concentration (<a href="pH.html">pH</a>), or it can be used as a <a href="reference electrode.html">reference electrode</a> if all the concentrations are known and constant. It is used equally often for both purposes. It is also the most fundamental reference electrode as the <a href="standard hydrogen electrode.html">standard hydrogen electrode</a>.
