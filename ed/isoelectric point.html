            <h2>isoelectric point</h2>
            
For some <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a>, typically those covered by, or consist of, metal oxides, the <a href="electrical charge.html">charge</a> on the electrode is a function not only of the <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a> but also of the <a href="pH.html">pH</a> of the solution. The pH value at which the charge on the electrode is zero is called the isoelectric point. It as also used in <a href="colloid.html">colloid chemistry</a> to indicate the pH at which the charge on the colloid particles is zero. Also called "isoelectronic point" and "point of zero charge".
