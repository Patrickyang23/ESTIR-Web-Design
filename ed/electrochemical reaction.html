            <h2>electrochemical reaction</h2>
            
An <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation/reduction</a> reaction that occurs in an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a>. The essential feature is that the simultaneously occurring oxidation-reduction reactions are spatially separated. E.g., in a spontaneous "chemical reaction" during the oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen to water, <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> are passed directly from the hydrogen to the oxygen. In contrast, in the spontaneous electrochemical reaction in a <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a> two separate <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reactions</a> occur. The <a href="hydrogen oxidation reaction.html">hydrogen is oxidized</a> at the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> by transferring electrons to the anode and the <a href="oxygen reduction reaction.html">oxygen is reduced</a> at the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> by accepting electrons from the cathode. The <a href="cell reaction.html">overall electrochemical reaction</a> is the sum of the two <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reactions</a>. The <a href="ion.html">ions</a> produced in the electrode reactions, in this case positive hydrogen ions and the negative hydroxyl (OH<sup>-</sup>) ions will recombine in the solution to form the final product of the reaction: water. During this process the electrons are carried from the anode to the cathode through an outside electrical circuit where the electronic current can drive a motor, light a light bulb, etc. The reaction can also be reversed, <a href="water electrolysis.html">water can be decomposed</a> into hydrogen and oxygen by the application of <a href="electrical power.html">electrical power</a> in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a>.
