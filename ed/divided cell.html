An <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> in which the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> is divided into two or more compartments by <a href="separator.html">separators</a>. Such separation may be necessary for two reasons. The solutions around the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> and the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> may be different and it may be desirable to keep them from intermixing. Alternatively, it may be desirable to keep the products of the reactions at the anode and the cathode separated. Contrast with <a href="undivided cell.html">undivided cell</a>.
