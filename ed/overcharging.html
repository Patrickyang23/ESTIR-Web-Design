            <h2>overcharging</h2>
            
During the <a href="charging.html">charging</a> of a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a>, eventually enough <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charge</a> is supplied to convert all the active material stored in the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a>. If charging continues, the battery is said to be "overcharged". It very much depends on the battery system whether overcharging is detrimental to the battery or not.
