            <h2>scanning electrochemical microscopy</h2>
            
In scanning electrochemical microscopy an <a href="ultramicroelectrode.html">ultramicroelectrode</a> is scanned across a surface to collect both topographic and chemical information about the surface and near-surface region. It works by measuring a <a href="current.html">current</a> through the electrode held or scanned in a solution in close proximity to a substrate surface. Substrates can be a variety of solid surfaces such as metals, glass, polymers or biological materials, etc. The substrate perturbs the electrochemical response of the tip, and this perturbation provides information about the nature and properties of the substrate. Abbreviated as "SECM". See also an <a href="/encycl/art-m04-microscopy.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
