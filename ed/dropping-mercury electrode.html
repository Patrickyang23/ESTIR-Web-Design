A <a href="working electrode.html">working electrode</a> arrangement for <a href="electroanalytical chemistry.html">electroanalytical</a> techniques, such as <a href="polarography.html">polarography</a>. Mercury is flowing continuously through a <a href="capillary.html">capillary</a> tubing forming a small droplet (typical diameter about one &gt;/<a href="mm.html">mm</a>) exposed to the solution. The old drop falls off and a new drop forms typically every few (3-6) seconds. The advantage of this self-renewing <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> is that the effect of impurities in the solution is minimized. Typically a new drop will form before impurities have a chance to <a href="adsorption.html">adsorb</a> on the surface of the old drop to such an extent as to influence the <a href="charge-transfer reaction.html">charge-transfer reaction</a>. Abbreviated as "dme".
