            <h2>rds</h2>
            
Stands for <a href="rate-determining step.html">rate-determining step</a>.

<h2><em><a name="r43">RE</a></em></h2><p>
Stands for <a href="reference electrode.html">reference electrode</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="r17">reactant</a></em></h2><p>
A chemical species that is taking part in a chemical reaction by reacting (sometimes by itself, but usually with other reactants) to form the products of the reaction.</p>
<h2><em><a name="r15"> (electrode) reaction mechanism</a></em></h2><p>
The totality of all the <a href="elementary reaction step.html">elementary reaction steps</a> occurring in series or parallel that fully defines the overall <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="r11">reaction overpotential (polarization)</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="overpotential.html">overpotential</a> (alternatively called <a href="polarization.html">polarization</a>) associated with a chemical reaction (without <a href="charge-transfer reaction.html">charge transfer</a>) step that is an <a href="elementary reaction step.html">elementary step</a> in the overall <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a>.</p>

See <a href="true electrode area.html">true electrode area</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="r01">rechargeable battery</a></em></h2><p>
A <a href="battery.html">battery</a> in which the chemical reaction system providing the electrical <a href="current.html">current</a> is easily "chemically" <a href="reversible electrode reaction.html">reversible</a>. After <a href="discharging.html">discharging</a>, it can be <a href="charging.html">recharged</a> by applying an electrical <a href="current.html">current</a> to its <a href="terminal.html">terminals</a>. Some batteries can be recharged hundreds to thousands times. Also called "secondary" battery, and "accumulator". Contrast with <a href="non-rechargeable battery.html">non-rechargeable battery</a>. Some common rechargeable batteries are the <a href="alkaline battery.html">alkaline battery</a>, <a href="Edison battery.html">Edison battery</a>, <a href="lead-acid battery.html">lead-acid battery</a>, <a href="lithium-ion battery.html">lithium-ion battery</a>, <a href="nickel-cadmium battery.html">nickel-cadmium battery</a>, <a href="nickel-iron battery.html">nickel-iron battery</a>, <a href="nickel-metal-hydride battery.html">nickel-metal-hydride battery</a>. </p>

It operates as a <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a> during <a href="discharging.html">discharge</a> and as an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> during <a href="charging.html">charge</a>. As a consequence, the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> is the negative <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> during discharge, while it is the positive electrode during charge; at the same time, the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> is the positive electrode during discharge, while it is the negative electrode during charge. This can create a confusing situation, and it is preferable to refer to the electrodes of a rechargeable battery as "positive" and "negative", because this designation is independent of the operational mode. Unfortunately, this nomenclature is not always followed. Often the "negative" electrode is designated as <a href="anode.html">anode</a> and the "positive" electrode is designated as <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>. This naming convention is a carry-over from the convention of the <a href="non-rechargeable battery.html">non-rechargeable battery</a>.
