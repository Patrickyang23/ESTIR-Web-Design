            <h2>overpotential</h2>
            
The difference in the <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a> of an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> between its <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> and its operating potential when a <a href="current.html">current</a> is flowing. The overpotential represents the extra <a href="energy.html">energy</a> needed (an energy loss that appears as heat) to force the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> to proceed at a required rate (or its equivalent <a href="current density.html">current density</a>). Consequently, the operating potential of an <a href="anode.html">anode</a> is always more positive than its equilibrium potential, while the operating potential of a <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> is always more negative than its equilibrium potential. The overpotential increases with increasing <a href="current density.html">current density</a>, see <a href="Tafel equation.html">Tafel equation</a>. The value of the overpotential also depends on the "inherent speed" of the electrode reaction: a slow reaction (with small <a href="exchange current density.html">exchange current density</a>) will require a larger overpotential for a given current density than a fast reaction (with large exchange current density). Also referred to as "polarization" of the electrode. See also <a href="overvoltage.html">overvoltage</a>.
