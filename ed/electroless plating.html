            <h2>electroless plating</h2>
            
Process to produce thin metallic coatings on objects without the application of external <a href="current.html">current</a>. The plating bath contains a dissolved salt of the metal and a <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reducing</a> agent. However, the reduction of the metal <a href="cation.html">cation</a> to metal occurs only on the surface of the object to be coated due to the <a href="catalysis.html">catalytic</a> nature of the surface. The advantages of this process over <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a> are the possibility to produce coatings on <a href="insulator (electrical).html">insulator</a> materials, and to produce uniform thickness coatings on geometrically complex surfaces.
