A slow <a href="discharging.html">discharging</a> of a <a href="battery.html">battery</a> without being connected to an external <a href="load.html">load</a>. This is caused partly by impurities and side reactions (reactions other than the <a href="cell reaction.html">cell reaction</a>) and partly by the imperfect separation of the active chemicals in the battery causing a slow "direct" reaction between them. The rate of the self discharge determines the <a href="shelf life.html">shelf life</a> of a <a href="non-rechargeable battery.html">non-rechargeable battery</a>.
