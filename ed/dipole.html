            <h2>dipole</h2>
            
A pair of equal and opposite <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charges</a> separated by a small distance. A dipole will align itself, if possible, in the presence of other electrical charges according to the attraction of opposite and repulsion of like charges. Externally electrically <a href="neutralization.html">neutral</a> chemical <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a> can have a dipole inside. E.g., water is a triangular molecule with the oxygen at one corner and the two hydrogens at the other two corners. The internal charge distribution is such that the hydrogen side has a slight excess of positive charge and the oxygen end is correspondingly negative. A dipole is characterized by its "dipole moment", the product of the charge and the separation distance (<a href="coulomb.html">coulomb</a> times <a href="centimeter.html">centimeter</a>).
