            <h2>solvation</h2>
            
<a href="ion.html">Ions</a> in solution are always surrounded by solvent <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a>. A few of these molecules will be more or less strongly attached to the ion (mainly because of the attraction of the <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> ion and the <a href="dipole.html">dipole</a> of the solvent molecule) and this assembly may be considered as a single unit for some purposes. E.g., the solvent molecules will move together with the ion during <a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a> and <a href="electromigration.html">electromigration</a>. The number of solvent molecules so attached to an ion is called the "solvation number". The surface of an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> also can, and usually is, solvated. Since the electrodes usually have some excess charge (see <a href="electrical double layer.html">electrical double layer</a>,) they also attract the solvent dipoles, and the electrode surface is usually covered by a monolayer of strongly oriented solvent molecules. Under certain extreme conditions, a solution can contain free <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> that are stabilized by solvation.
