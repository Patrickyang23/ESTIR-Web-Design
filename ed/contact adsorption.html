<a href="adsorption.html">Adsorption</a> with the adsorbed <a href="molecule.html">molecule</a> or <a href="ion.html">ion</a> being in direct contact with the solid surface.


<h2><em><a name="c66">convection</a></em></h2><p>
A <a href="mass transport.html">mass-transport</a> mechanism that involves bulk movement of a solution (contrast with <a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a> that involves individual <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a> or <a href="ion.html">ions</a>). We differentiate "forced" convection from "natural" convection. The simplest example of forced convection is mechanical stirring. If a non-uniform solution is stirred, the <a href="solute.html">solute</a> is "transported" from the high <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> parts of the solution to the low concentration parts till the solution becomes completely uniform. Other examples of forced convection are the "flow" of a solution through a pipe or a porous <a href="separator.html">separator</a> driven by pressure difference. "Natural" convection is very important in electrochemistry. It always occurs at the surface of an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> carrying <a href="current.html">current</a> in the absence of "forced" convection. As <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> is proceeding, the buildup of reaction products and the consumption of <a href="reactant.html">reactants</a> changes the density of the solution layer close to the electrode surface compared to that of the bulk solution. Eventually, this density difference will force the surface solution layer to sink or rise, setting up a "natural stirring" action close to the electrode surface which will tend to equalize the surface and bulk <a href="concentration.html">concentrations</a>. As a "rule of thumb", natural convection starts after about a minute of current flow.</p>

<h2><em><a name="c45">corrosion</a></em></h2><p>
A chemical (often electrochemical) process that destroys structural materials. Typically it refers to corrosion of metals, but any other material (e.g., plastic or <a href="semiconductor.html">semiconductor</a>) will also corrode. The simplest example of metallic corrosion is the rusting of iron in air. Iron is spontaneously <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> by the oxygen in air to iron oxides (while the oxygen is being <a href="oxygen reduction reaction.html">reduced</a>). Metallic corrosion is very often an electrochemical process. It is always electrochemical when the metal is immersed in a solution, but even in atmospheric corrosion a thin film of condensed moisture often covers the surface. The metal in the corrosive solution essentially acts as a <a href="short-circuit current.html">short-circuited</a> <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a>. Different areas of the surface act as <a href="anode.html">anode</a> and <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>, at the anodic areas the metal is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> to an oxide while at the cathodic areas the dissolved oxygen is being <a href="oxygen reduction reaction.html">reduced</a>. The spontaneous complementary oxidation/reduction processes of "rusting" are spatially separated while an electrical <a href="current.html">current</a> is flowing "internally" from one part of the corroding metal to another; the current is totally "wasted" as it produces no useful work but only generates heat. (A cell arrangement like this is often called a "local cell".)  See <a href="corrosion current (density).html">corrosion current</a> and <a href="corrosion potential.html">corrosion potential</a>. See also an <a href="../encycl/art-c02-corrosion.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.</p>

Corrosion products are typically oxides, but other products (e.g., sulfides) can also form depending on the environment. Corrosion always involves <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation</a> of the corroding material in the general sense of the term.
