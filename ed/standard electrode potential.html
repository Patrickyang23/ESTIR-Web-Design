The <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> of an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> when both the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized and the reduced</a> species are present in unit <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> (strictly speaking, <a href="activity.html">activity</a>) in the solution; if the "reduced" form is a metal, a pure metal (not alloyed with other metals) is considered to be at unit concentration. (See also the <a href="Nernst equation.html">Nernst equation</a>.) The standard potentials are always expressed against the <a href="standard hydrogen electrode.html">standard hydrogen electrode</a> the potential of which is zero "by definition". Standard potentials are a function of the temperature, they are usually tabulated for 25<sup>o</sup>C (77<sup>o</sup>F). Also called "normal electrode potential".
