<h2><em><a name="i21">indirect electrolysis</a></em></h2><p>
The production of chemicals in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> through <a href="intermediate.html">intermediate</a> electrolysis products. It is often used in the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation/reduction</a> of organic compounds that would otherwise react very slowly at the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surface. An intermediate oxidizing/reducing agent (a <a href="redox couple.html">redox couple</a>) is produced at the electrode surface and the agent reacts with the organic in the bulk solution. The agent is continuously regenerated by the electrolysis. A typical oxidizing agent is the ferric (tri-valent iron) <a href="ion.html">ion</a>, and an example of the reducing agent is the cerous (tri-valent cerium) ion. The reactive intermediate is often called a "redox mediator", and the overall reaction a "redox mediated reaction".</p>

<h2><em><a name="i58">indium tin oxide electrode</a></em></h2><p>
An <a href="optically transparent electrode.html">optically transparent electrode</a> consisting of a thin film of <a href="semiconductor.html">semiconducting</a> mixed oxide coated onto a glass or quartz substrate, or by itself. Such an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a>, which is transparent to light and is also <a href="conductor (electrical).html">conductor of electricity</a>, is a prerequisite for <a href="spectroelectrochemistry.html">spectroelectrochemical</a> measurements. Abbreviated as ITO.</p>
<h2><em><a name="i34">inert electrode</a></em></h2><p>
An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> that serves only as a source or sink for <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> without playing a chemical role in the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a>. <a href="noble metal.html">Noble metals</a>, mercury, and carbon are typically used as inert electrodes. See for example the <a href="redox electrode.html">redox electrode</a>.</p>

The "inert" nature of the electrode can sometimes be questioned. While the electrode may not take part in the reaction as a <a href="reactant.html">reactant</a> or product, it still can act as an <a href="electrocatalysis.html">electrocatalyst</a>.
