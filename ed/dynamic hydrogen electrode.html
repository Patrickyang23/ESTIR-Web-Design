A <a href="pseudo-reference electrode.html"> pseudo-reference electrode</a> assembly, simulating a <a href="reversible hydrogen electrode.html">reversible hydrogen electrode</a> with an approximately 20 to 40 <a href="mV.html">mV</a> more negative <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a>. While its potential is less defined, it has the advantage of not requiring a hydrogen gas supply. It is typically a glass tube containing two internal <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a>, at least one of which is a <a href="platinized platinum electrode.html">platinized platinum electrode</a>, immersed in the same <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte solution</a> as is the electrolyte in the working <a href="electrochemical cell.html">cell</a>, with the two electrolytes in <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionic</a> contact through a <a href="separator.html">separator</a>. A small, constant <a href="current.html">current</a> is enforced between the two electrodes with the platinized platinum being the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>, carrying typically 1 <a href="mA.html">mA</a>/<a href="cm2.html">cm<sup>2</sup></a> <a href="current density.html">current density</a>, resulting in a small amount of <a href="hydrogen evolution reaction.html">hydrogen evolution</a>. This cathode is then used as the reference electrode. Abbreviated as "DHE".
