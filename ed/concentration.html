            <h2>concentration</h2>
            
The measure of the amount of dissolved material (<a href="solute.html">solute</a>) in a solution. It can be expressed in a variety of ways. Expressions in weight percent, and <a href="gram.html">grams</a> of solute per <a href="liter.html">liter</a> of solution are common. A more fundamental way to express concentration is used in chemistry: the "molar" concentration. A solution is considered one molar (1 M) if it contains as many grams of solute per liter of solution as is the <a href="molecular weight.html">molecular weight</a> of the solute (the so called <a href="gram-mole.html">gram-mole</a>). This provides an <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">atomistically</a> fundamental expression because one gram-mole of any material will contain the same (and very large) number of <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a>. One gram-mole of hydrogen gas contains the exact same number of molecules as one gram-mole of table salt (sodium chloride), even though the latter is much heavier. In this dictionary, the term "concentration" always designates "molarity" unless otherwise specified.
