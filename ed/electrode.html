The two <a href="electronic conductor.html">electronically conducting</a> parts of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a>. See also <a href="anode.html">anode</a> and <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>. These can be simple metallic structures (rods, sheets, etc) or much more complicated, composite structures. E.g., the electrodes in a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> will also "contain" the chemicals being converted during its operation. The term "electrode" is also used to denote complex assemblies that include an electrode in a small vessel, which contains an <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> and is equipped with an <a href="ion.html">ion</a>-permeable <a href="separator.html">separator</a>. <a href="reference electrode.html">Reference electrodes</a> are such assemblies.
