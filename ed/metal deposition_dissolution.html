            <h2>metal deposition/dissolution</h2>
            
A class of <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reactions</a> involving <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation/reduction</a> of a solid metal and its dissolved <a href="ion.html">ion</a>. E.g., if a copper metal rod is immersed in a copper sulfate solution, the copper <a href="cation.html">cations</a> can be <a href="cathode.html">cathodically</a> reduced to copper metal, or the copper metal can be <a href="anode.html">anodically</a> oxidized to copper ions. Compare with a <a href="redox reaction.html">redox reaction</a> where both the oxidized and the reduced species are in solution. The terms "electrodeposition" and "electrodissolution" are often used to describe these reactions. These reactions are used in many technologies, such as  <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a>, <a href="electrowinning.html">electrowinning</a>, <a href="electrorefining.html">electrorefining</a>, and <a href="metal powder production by electrolysis.html">production of metal powders</a>. And also in <a href="electrogravimetry.html">electrogravimetry</a>.
