The Faraday Number (or constant) gives the amount of <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charge</a> needed to change one <a href="gram-equivalent.html">gram-equivalent</a> of substance by <a href="electrochemical reaction.html">electrochemical reaction</a>. Its value is 96,485.34 <a href="coulomb.html">coulombs</a> or 26.80 <a href="ampere-hour.html">ampere-hours</a>. This charge is often simply called one "Faraday". Symbol: "F", which is the same as the symbol of the <a href="farad.html">farad</a>. It is usually obvious from the context which meaning is appropriate.
