Similar to a <a href="standard electrode potential.html">standard electrode potential</a> except that both the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized and the reduced</a> species are present in unit <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> instead of unit <a href="activity.html">activity</a>. It is not as well defined as the standard potential but it is useful in cases when the activities are unknown.
