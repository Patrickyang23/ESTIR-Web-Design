For a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery:</a> the fraction, usually expressed as a percentage, of the <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charge</a> <a href="energy storage.html">stored</a> in a battery by <a href="charging.html">charging</a> that is recoverable during <a href="discharging.html">discharging</a>. Inefficiencies arise from <a href="current efficiency.html">current inefficiencies</a>. The coulometric efficiency is always larger than the <a href="energy efficiency.html">energy efficiency</a>. Also called "ampere-hour efficiency" "charge efficiency", and "coulombic efficiency".
