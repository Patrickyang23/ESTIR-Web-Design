            <h2>packed-bed electrode</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> assembly consisting of loosely packed small particles of the electrode material (e.g., some metal or carbon) with the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> flowing through the bed. This type of electrode is especially useful for removing small traces of impurities from the solution by <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a> (e.g., waste treatment) because the solution is well stirred and it contacts a large surface of the electrode material.
