A commonly used <a href="reference electrode.html">reference electrode</a>. The <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> assembly consists of a silver metal electrode in contact with solid silver chloride (usually as a coating on the silver metal) immersed in an <a href="aqueous solution.html">aqueous</a> chloride salt solution <a href="solubility.html">saturated</a> with silver chloride. All these are contained in a small vessel, typically made of glass tubing. The <a href="internal electrolyte.html">internal electrolyte</a> of the reference electrode assembly and the <a href="external electrolyte.html">external electrolyte</a> into which the whole assembly is immersed are in <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionic</a> contact through a <a href="separator.html">separator</a>. A typical separator is a small porous ceramic plug sealed into the end of the glass tubing. Abbreviated as "SSCE".
