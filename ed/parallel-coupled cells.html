            <h2>parallel-coupled cells</h2>
            
Individual <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cells</a> can be combined in assemblies by parallel or <a href="series-coupled cells.html">series</a> coupling (or a combination of the two). In case of "parallel" coupling, the positive <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> of every cell is connected together and the negative electrode of every cell is connected together, resulting in two external <a href="terminal.html">terminals</a>. The <a href="cell voltage.html">voltage</a> of every cell must be identical in parallel coupled assemblies. The overall <a href="current.html">current</a> passing through the assembly is the sum of the individual cell currents, while the assembly voltage is identical to the individual cell voltage. Parallel coupling is often used in <a href="battery.html">batteries</a>. Cell <a href="cell line.html">lines</a> and <a href="stack.html">stacks</a> can also be parallel coupled. Parallel coupling can be used for any elements of an electrical or electronic circuit: elements of the circuit are connected to common points at each end, so that the current is divided between them. Contrast with <a href="series-coupled cells.html">series coupling</a>.
