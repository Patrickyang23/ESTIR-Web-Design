            <h2>series-coupled cells</h2>
            
Individual <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cells</a> can be combined in assemblies by series or <a href="parallel-coupled cells.html">parallel</a> coupling (or a combination of the two). In case of "series" coupling, the positive <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> of one cell is connected to the negative electrode of the next cell, and so on. The assembly has only two external <a href="terminal.html">terminals</a>. The overall voltage of the assembly is the sum of the individual <a href="cell voltage.html">cell voltages</a>, while the <a href="current.html">current</a> passing through every cell (and the assembly) is the same. Series coupling can be used in a number of assemblies, such as <a href="battery.html">battery</a>, <a href="cell line.html">cell line</a>, and <a href="stack.html">stack</a>. Series coupling can be used for any elements of an electrical or electronic circuit: elements of the circuit are arranged in such a way that the current passes through each of them successively, without branching. Contrast with <a href="parallel-coupled cells.html">parallel coupling</a>.
