A <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> with two <a href="redox electrode.html">redox electrodes</a> contained in compartments typically <a href="separator.html">separated</a> by an <a href="ion-exchange membrane.html">ion-exchange membrane</a> E.g., a battery with iron and chromium <a href="redox couple.html">redox couples</a> in the two compartments. During <a href="discharging.html">discharge</a>, "ferric" (trivalent iron) <a href="cation.html">cations</a> are <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduced</a> to "ferrous" (divalent iron) <a href="ion.html">ions</a> at one of the redox electrodes, while "chromous" (divalent chromium) ions are <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> to "chromic" (trivalent chromium) ions at the other electrode. The reverse reactions occur during <a href="charging.html">charging</a>. An advantage of this system is that the <a href="polarization.html">polarization losses</a> are relatively small because the redox reactions are typically fast and no solid phases are being formed during the reaction. Also, the solutions containing the iron and chromium salts can be stored in separate large tanks and circulated to a small "battery", permitting the <a href="energy storage.html">storage</a> of large amounts of energy.
