<h2><em><a name="e163">electrolyzed water</a></em></h2><p>
A dilute bleach solution produced by a brief <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a> of ordinary tap water containing some dissolved table salt, according the process described under <a href="brine electrolysis.html">brine electrolysis</a>. It is used as a disinfectant. Also called "electro-activated water".

<h2><em><a name="e140">electromagnetic field</a></em></h2><p>
A field of force associated with a moving electric charge and consisting of <a href="electrical field.html"> electric</a> and <a href="magnetic field.html">magnetic fields</a> that are generated at right angles to each other.</p>
<h2><em><a name="e89">electrometallurgy</a></em></h2><p>
Branch of metallurgy (science dealing with the production of metals) using electrochemical processes, that is <a href="electrowinning.html">electrowinning</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="e48">electrometer</a></em></h2><p>
A <a href="voltmeter.html">voltmeter</a> with very large input <a href="resistance.html">resistance</a>. A typical modern voltmeter has an input resistance of around ten million <a href="ohm.html">ohms</a>, an electrometer can have ten million times more. Electrometers are used to measure the <a href="electromotive force.html">electromotive force</a> of <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cells</a> that can be easily <a href="polarization.html">polarized</a> by <a href="current.html">current</a>. The voltmeter always draws a small current, the magnitude depends on the ratio of the resistance of the cell and the voltmeter. High resistance cells (e.g., one containing a <a href="glass electrode.html">glass electrode</a>, must be measured with an electrometer.</p>
<h2><em><a name="e44">electromigration</a></em></h2><p>
The movement of <a href="ion.html">ions</a> under the influence of <a href="electrical potential.html">electrical potential</a> difference.</p>
<h2><em><a name="e32">electromotive force</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="cell voltage.html">cell voltage</a> of a <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a> measured when there is no <a href="current.html">current</a> flowing through the cell. In other words, the <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium electrode potential</a> difference between the two <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> of the cell. Abbreviated as "emf".</p>
<h2><em><a name="e114">electromotive series</a></em></h2><p>
A tabulation on which various substances, such as metals or <a href="element, chemical.html"> elements</a>, are listed according to their chemical reactivity or <a href="standard electrode potential.html"> standard electrode potential</a>. It is usually ordered with increasing standard electrode potentials (most negative on top). For metals, the order indicates the tendency to spontaneously <a href="oxidation_reduction.html"> reduce</a> the <a href="ion.html"> ions</a> of any other metal below it in the series (see <a href="cementation.html"> cementation</a>). During <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolytic</a> <a href="oxidation_reduction.html"> reduction</a> of <a href="cation.html">cations</a> (e.g., <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a>) an element lower in the series (more positive) will deposit first, and an element higher in the series (more negative) will deposit only when the solution is practically depleted of the ions of the first element. Also called "electrochemical series" and "galvanic series".</p>
<h2><em><a name="e106">electron</a></em></h2><p>
See <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">atomic structure</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="e121">electronation</a></em></h2><p>
Alternative name of a <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduction process</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="e77">electroneutrality condition</a></em></h2><p>
The expression of nature's tendency to keep any system electrically <a href="neutralization.html">neutral</a>, that is, if it contains <a href="electrical charge.html">electrically charged</a> particles the total sum of negative charges will be equal to the total sum of positive charges. Applying this condition to a solution of <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolytes</a> implies the equality of the total positive <a href="ion.html">ionic</a> charges to the total negative ionic charges. This equality should hold even as we subdivide the solution into smaller and smaller volume elements.</p>

This condition results from the statistical distribution of the ions around each other considering the attractive tendency of oppositely charged particles and the repulsive tendency of similarly charged particles. Consequently, there is a statistical limit of the size of the volume element to which it applies. At the extreme, a volume small enough to contain only a single ion obviously cannot be electrically neutral.
