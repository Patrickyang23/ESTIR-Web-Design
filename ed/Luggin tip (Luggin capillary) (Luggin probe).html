A <a href="salt bridge.html">salt bridge</a> with a thin, <a href="capillary.html">capillary</a> tip at one end. This can be useful for minimizing the <a href="solution ir drop.html">solution ir drop</a> by placing the fine capillary tip very close to the surface of the working electrode, when the salt bridge is used to connect the <a href="working electrode.html">working</a> and <a href="reference electrode.html">reference</a> electrode compartments of a <a href="three-electrode cell.html">three-electrode cell</a>. The solution distance causing the ir drop can be easily limited to a few <a href="millimeter.html">millimeters</a>; and, in specially designed cells, often to a much smaller distance.
