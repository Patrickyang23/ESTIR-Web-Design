            <h2>fuel cell</h2>
            
A device that <a href="energy conversion.html">converts</a> chemical <a href="energy.html">energy</a> into <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a>. It is different from a <a href="battery.html">battery</a> in that the <a href="energy conversion.html">energy conversion</a> continues as long as fuel and oxidizing agent are fed to the fuel cell; that is, in principle indefinitely. (A battery is manufactured with a limited amount of chemicals, and it is exhausted when all the chemicals have reacted.) It is a <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a>, where spontaneous chemical reactions occur at the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a>. The fuel is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> at the <a href="anode.html">anode</a>, and the oxidizing agent (almost always oxygen or air) is <a href="oxygen reduction reaction.html">reduced</a> at the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>. Presently, the most commonly used fuel is hydrogen. More conventional fuels (e.g., gasoline or natural gas) must be converted (<a href="reforming.html">reformed</a>) into hydrogen before they can be utilized in a fuel cell. Fuel cells that can burn hydrocarbon fuels directly are in the development stage. Some fuel cells employ an <a href="aqueous solution.html">aqueous solution</a> as <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a>, that can be either <a href="acid.html">acidic</a> or <a href="base.html">basic</a> (alkaline), or an <a href="ion-exchange membrane.html">ion-exchange membrane</a> soaked in aqueous solution can act as the electrolyte (see <a href="PEM.html">PEM</a>) these fuel cells operate at relatively low temperatures (from room temperature to not much above the boiling point of water). Some fuel cells employ molten salts (especially carbonates) as electrolytes and have to operate at many hundreds of <sup>o</sup>C temperature. Others employ <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionically conductive</a> solids as electrolyte and must operate close to 1000<sup>o</sup>C (1832<sup>o</sup>F). Abbreviated as "FC". Some common fuel cells are the <a href="alkaline fuel cell.html"> alkaline fuel cell</a>, <a href="alkaline membrane fuel cell.html"> alkaline membrane fuel cell</a>, <a href="direct-formic-acid fuel cell.html"> direct-formic-acid fuel cell</a>, <a href="direct-methanol fuel cell.html"> direct-methanol fuel cell</a>, <a href="internal-reforming fuel cell.html"> internal-reforming fuel cell</a>, <a href="micro fuel cell.html"> micro fuel cell</a>, <a href="molten-carbonate fuel cell.html"> molten-carbonate fuel cell</a>, <a href="phosphoric-acid fuel cell.html"> phosphoric-acid fuel cell</a>, <a href="polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cell.html"> polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cell</a>, <a href="proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell.html"> proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell</a>, <a href="reversible fuel cell.html"> reversible fuel cell</a>, and <a href="solid-oxide fuel cell.html"> solid-oxide fuel cell</a>.
