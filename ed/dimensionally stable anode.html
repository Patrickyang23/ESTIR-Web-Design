            <h2>dimensionally stable anode</h2>
            
A modern <a href="anode.html">anode</a> used in <a href="brine electrolysis.html">brine electrolysis</a>. It is essentially a sheet of titanium metal coated with a mixture of active metal oxides, the coating is stable and has a very long life time under cell operating conditions. Contrast it with the traditionally used <a href="carbon electrode.html">carbon electrode</a> that was slowly consumed during cell operation; it had to be replaced periodically and required the rebuilding of the cell. Abbreviated as "DSA".
