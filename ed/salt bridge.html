An <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionically conducting</a> path between separate compartments of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a>. Often the <a href="working electrode.html">working</a> and <a href="reference electrode.html">reference</a> (and occasionally even the <a href="counter electrode.html">counter</a>) electrodes are in completely separate compartments and the required conducting path between them is provided by a tubing filled with highly conducting <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> solution. A common arrangement for a "salt bridge" is an inverted "U" shaped glass tubing with its ends dipped into the solutions of the two cell compartments; however, other materials and shapes are also used. The salt bridge may contain any conducting solution, but very often a highly concentrated potassium chloride solution (often immobilized by some gelling agent, for example <a href="agar.html">agar</a>) is used.
