            <h2>passivation</h2>
            
The formation of a thin adherent film or layer on the surface of a metal or mineral that acts as a protective coating to protect the underlying surface from further chemical reaction, such as <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a>, <a href="electrodissolution.html">electrodissolution</a>, or dissolution. The passive film is very often, though not always, an oxide. A passivated surface is often said to be in a "passive state". The surface <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation</a> can result from chemical or electrochemical (<a href="anode.html">anodic</a>) oxidation. During anodic passivation, using <a href="voltammetry.html">linear-sweep voltammetry</a>, the <a href="current.html">current</a> first increases with <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a>, then falls to a very small value. See <a href="passivation potential.html">passivation potential</a>. See also an <a href="/encycl/art-c02-corrosion.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
