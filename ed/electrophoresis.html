As a phenomenon: the movement of small suspended particles or very large <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a> in a liquid driven by an <a href="electrical potential.html">electrical potential</a> difference. Also called "cataphoresis". See <a href="electrokinetic effects (electrokinetics).html">electrokinetic effects</a>. As an <a href="electroanalytical chemistry.html">electroanalytical</a> technique: a separation method for very large organic molecules (usually of biological origin) based on their different electrophoretic velocities through an "immobilized" liquid phase. The liquid can be immobilized by a variety of "supports", e.g.: paper, gelatinous material, <a href="capillary.html">capillary</a> tubing.
