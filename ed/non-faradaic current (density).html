<h2><em><a name="n09">non-nernstian behavior</a></em></h2><p>
An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> is said to behave "non-nernstially" if the <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium electrode potential</a> does not obey the <a href="Nernst equation.html">Nernst equation</a> when the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> (strictly speaking, <a href="activity.html">activity</a>) of a species involved in the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> changes. Opposite: <a href="nernstian behavior.html">nernstian behavior</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="n17">non-ohmic resistance (behavior)</a></em></h2><p>
A system or system element is behaving "non-ohmically" if it does not follow <a href="Ohm's Law.html">Ohm's law</a>. That is, the value of the <a href="resistance.html">resistance</a> depends on the <a href="current.html">current</a> or the <a href="electrical potential.html">potential</a>. Opposite: <a href="ohmic resistance (behavior).html">ohmic</a> behavior.</p>

The resistance can be formally defined as the differential of the potential with respect of the current. In the case of Ohm's law, this is the constant value of the resistance. In electrochemistry, a typical "non-ohmic" element is the <a href="charge-transfer resistance.html">charge-transfer resistance</a>. The <a href="charge-transfer reaction.html">charge-transfer reaction</a> can be considered a circuit element because it requires a certain amount of <a href="overpotential.html">overpotential</a> to force through a current. However, the pertinent relation here is the <a href="Tafel equation.html">Tafel law</a> (at least at relatively large overpotentials), and the differential of the current (that is the resistance) is a function of the current itself.
