            <h2>counter electrode</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> in a <a href="three-electrode cell.html">three-electrode cell</a> that is used only to make an electrical connection to the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> so that a current can be applied to the <a href="working electrode.html">working electrode</a>. The processes occurring on the counter electrode are unimportant, it is usually made of inert materials (<a href="noble metal.html">noble metals</a> or carbon/graphite) to avoid its dissolution. This is the case for cells used for research or for <a href="electroanalytical chemistry.html">electroanalytical</a> purposes. Of course, for many practically used cells, the processes occurring on both electrodes can be very important. Also called "auxiliary" electrode. Abbreviated as "CE".
