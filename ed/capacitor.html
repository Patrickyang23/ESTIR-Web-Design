An electrical device which serves to <a href="energy storage.html">store</a> electricity or <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a>. It has three essential parts: two electrical <a href="conductor (electrical).html">conductors</a>, which are usually metal plates, separated and <a href="insulator (electrical).html">insulated</a> by the third part called the <a href="dielectric.html">dielectric</a>. The plates are charged with equal amounts of positive and negative <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charges</a>, respectively. This is a "physical" <a href="energy storage.html">storage</a> of electricity as compared with the "chemical" storage in a <a href="battery.html">battery</a>. See also <a href="electrolytic capacitor.html"> electrolytic capacitors</a> and <a href="electrochemical capacitor.html"> electrochemical capacitors</a>.
