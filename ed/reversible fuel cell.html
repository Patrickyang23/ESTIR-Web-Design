            <h2>reversible fuel cell</h2>
            
Essentially a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> built with <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cell</a> technology. For example, during <a href="charging.html">charging</a>, water is <a href="water electrolysis.html">electrolyzed</a> using <a href="porous electrode.html">porous electrodes</a>, and the resulting oxygen and hydrogen gases are stored under pressure. During <a href="discharging.html">discharging</a>, the same cell is used as a fuel cell and the gases are recombined to produce water and electricity. Similar arrangements could be made with hydrogen-chlorine and hydrogen-bromine systems.
