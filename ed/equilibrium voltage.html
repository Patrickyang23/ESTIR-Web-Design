<h2><em><a name="e131">equivalent circuit</a></em></h2><p>
An electrical circuit (usually comprised of <a href="series-coupled cells.html">series</a> and <a href="parallel-coupled cells.html">parallel</a> coupled <a href="resistor.html">resistors</a> and <a href="capacitor.html">capacitors</a>) that models the fundamental properties and behavior of <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> or <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cells</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="e75">equivalent weight</a></em></h2><p>
A characteristic weight of a substance relating to a specific reaction the substance participates. In <a href="electrochemical reaction.html">electrochemical reactions</a>, the <a href="molecular weight.html">molecular weight</a> or <a href="atomic weight.html">atomic weight</a> divided by the number of <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> transferred during the reaction. Consequently, the equivalent weight of a substance can be different for different reactions. E.g. the equivalent weight of the cuprous <a href="ion.html">ion</a> (singly <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> copper ion) is equal to its atomic weight, independently whether it is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> to cupric ion (doubly charged copper ion) or it is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduced</a> to (electrically <a href="neutralization.html">neutral</a>) copper metal. On the other hand, the equivalent weight of the cupric ion is one half of its atomic weight if it is reduced to copper metal, but it is the atomic weight if it is reduced only to cuprous ion.</p>

In a wider sense, the molecular weight or the atomic weight divided by the valence change occurring during the reaction. For <a href="acid.html">acid</a>/<a href="base.html">base</a> reactions, the molecular weight divided by the number of hydrogen ions produced or consumed during the reaction.

<h2><em><a name="e41">exchange current density</a></em></h2><p>
At the <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> there is no <a href="net current (density).html">net current</a> flowing through the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a>. However, the <a href="equilibrium.html">equilibrium</a> is a dynamic one, that is, the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> proceeds at "equal rates" both in the forward and in the reverse direction, resulting in a zero "net" reaction rate and a zero "net" current. The rate of the electrode reaction can be expressed as an equivalent <a href="current density.html">current density</a> and the "exchange current density" of a reaction is the current density flowing "equally" in both directions in equilibrium. A large exchange current density indicates a fast reaction (see also <a href="non-polarizable electrode.html">non-polarizable electrode</a>), while a small exchange current density indicates a slow reaction (see also <a href="polarizable electrode.html">polarizable electrode</a>)</p>
<h2><em><a name="e39">external electrolyte</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> solution in the <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> into which the <a href="reference electrode.html">reference electrode</a> is immersed. Contrast with the <a href="internal electrolyte.html">internal electrolyte</a> of the reference electrode.</p>
