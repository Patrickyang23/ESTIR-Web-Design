            <h2>charge-transfer reaction</h2>
            
A chemical reaction where an <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charge</a> (usually an <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electron</a>) is transferred from one <a href="reactant.html">reactant</a> to another. See also <a href="heterogeneous charge-transfer reaction.html">heterogeneous charge-transfer reaction</a> and <a href="homogeneous charge-transfer reaction.html">homogeneous charge-transfer reaction</a>. In case of an <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a>, the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> itself is considered one of the "reactants". An electrode reaction is a heterogeneous charge-transfer reaction.
