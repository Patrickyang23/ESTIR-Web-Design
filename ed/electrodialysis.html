            <h2>electrodialysis</h2>
            
A process to move <a href="ion.html">ions</a> from one solution into another using an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a>. An example is the electrochemical <a href="desalination.html">desalination</a> of seawater. In its simplest form, the cell is separated into three compartments by appropriate <a href="ion-exchange membrane.html">ion-exchange membranes</a> with <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> placed in the two outer compartments, and all compartments are fed seawater. As an electrical <a href="current.html">current</a> is forced through the cell, <a href="anion.html">anions</a> will move from the central compartment through an anion-exchange membrane into the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> compartment and the <a href="cation.html">cations</a> will move through an cation-exchange membrane into the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> compartment. Since the <a href="ion-exchange membrane.html">ion-exchange membranes</a> are appropriately ion selective, the ions cannot move from the edge compartments to the central compartment, resulting in a desalinated effluent from that compartment. In practice, more than one cell will be connected in <a href="series-coupled cells.html">series</a>, and the process will be carried out in several stages since it would not be efficient to remove all the salt in one step. This process is also used to remove industrial pollutants from waste streams.
