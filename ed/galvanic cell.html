An <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> that <a href="energy conversion.html">converts</a> chemical <a href="energy.html">energy</a> into <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a>. A cell in which chemical reactions occur spontaneously at the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> when they are connected through an external circuit, producing an electrical <a href="current.html">current</a>. E.g., in a <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cell</a> <a href="hydrogen oxidation reaction.html">hydrogen is oxidized</a> at the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> by transferring <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> to the anode and the <a href="oxygen reduction reaction.html">oxygen is reduced</a> at the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> by accepting electrons from the cathode. During this process the electrons are carried from the anode to the cathode through an outside electrical circuit where the electrical current can drive a motor, light a light bulb, etc. Also called "voltaic" cell. In contrast, in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> <a href="electrical power.html">electrical power</a> must be supplied to force the non-spontaneous reverse reaction, the <a href="water electrolysis.html">electrolysis of water</a>. See also <a href="electrochemical reaction.html">electrochemical reaction</a>, <a href="battery.html">battery</a>, and <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cell</a>.
