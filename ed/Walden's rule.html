            <h2>Walden's rule</h2>
            
An empirical rule which states that the product of the <a href="viscosity.html">viscosity</a> and the <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionic conductance</a> at infinite dilution in <a href="electrolyte solution.html">electrolyte solutions</a> is a constant, independent of the solvent; it is only approximately correct.

<h2><em><a name="w07">Warburg impedance</a></em></h2><p>
The element in the <a href="equivalent circuit.html">equivalent circuit</a> of an electrochemical <a href="electrochemical cell.html">cell</a> or <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> that represents a <a href="diffusion.html">diffusional</a> processes.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w01">water electrolysis</a></em></h2><p>
Process for the electrochemical decomposition of water in a <a href="divided cell.html">divided</a> <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> by <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a>. Typically, hydrogen gas is produced at the steel <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> (see <a href="hydrogen evolution reaction.html">hydrogen evolution</a>) and oxygen gas is produced at the nickel <a href="anode.html">anode</a> (see <a href="oxygen evolution reaction.html">oxygen evolution</a>). The cell is divided to avoid mixing the hydrogen and oxygen gases. The <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> is typically an <a href="aqueous solution.html">aqueous</a> potassium hydroxide solution. Potassium hydroxide is used to provide a large <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionic conductivity</a>, even though the potassium is not reacting at any of the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> (see <a href="supporting electrolyte.html">supporting electrolyte)</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w04">watt</a></em></h2><p>
Measurement unit of <a href="electrical power.html">electrical power</a>. Symbol: "W". Related units are that of <a href="power density.html">power density</a>: watt/<a href="kilogram.html">kilogram</a> (W/kg) and watt/<a href="liter.html">liter</a> (W/l).</p>
<h2><em><a name="w06">watt-hour</a></em></h2><p>
Measurement unit of <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a>. Symbol: "Wh". One watt-hour is equal to 3600 <a href="joule.html">joule</a>. Related units are that of <a href="energy density.html">energy density</a>: watt-hour/<a href="kilogram.html">kilogram</a> (Wh/kg) and watt-hour/<a href="liter.html">liter</a> (Wh/l).</p>
<h2><em><a name="w11">WE</a></em></h2><p>
Stands for <a href="working electrode.html">working electrode</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w14">weak electrolyte</a></em></h2><p>
A weak electrolyte is a <a href="solute.html">solute</a> that <a href="dissociation.html">dissociates</a> only partially into <a href="ion.html">ions</a> in a solution. Resulting in a poorly <a href="conductivity (electrical).html">conducting</a> solution. Contrast with <a href="strong electrolyte.html">strong electrolyte</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w13">Weston cell</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="standard cell.html">standard cell</a> used during much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w03">Wh</a></em></h2><p>
Symbol and abbreviation of <a href="watt-hour.html">watt-hour</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w12">what is electrochemistry?</a></em></h2><p>
See an <a href="/encycl/art-i02-introduction.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w08">Wheatstone bridge</a></em></h2><p>
An early electrical instrument (circuit) for measuring an unknown <a href="resistance.html">resistance</a> by comparing it with known resistances.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w15">width at half-height</a></em></h2><p>
See <a href="peak width at half-height.html">peak width at half-height</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w09">Wien effect</a></em></h2><p>
The increase of the <a href="ionic mobility.html">mobility</a> of an <a href="ion.html">ion</a> in high <a href="electrical field.html">electrical field</a>. The mobility of an ion is somewhat decreased by the presence of the <a href="ionic atmosphere.html">ionic atmosphere</a> because the predominantly oppositely <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> ions surrounding the central ion will tend to hold it back. This effect is included in the normally measured mobility. However, when the ion is exposed to very high electrical field, it will move so fast that it will, in effect, leave behind its atmosphere which does not have time to reform, and the mobility of the ion (consequently the <a href="conductivity (electrical).html">electrical conductivity</a> of the solution) will increase. See also the <a href="Debye-Falkenhagen effect.html">Debye-Falkenhagen effect</a>.</p>
<h2><em><a name="w02">working electrode</a></em></h2><p>
The <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> in a <a href="three-electrode cell.html">three-electrode cell</a> where "the action is". The <a href="kinetics.html">kinetics</a> and <a href="(electrode) reaction mechanism.html">mechanism</a> of the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> may be under investigation, or the reaction occurring on the working electrode may be used to perform an <a href="electroanalytical chemistry.html">electrochemical analysis</a> of the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> solution. It can serve either as an <a href="anode.html">anode</a> or a <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>, depending on the applied <a href="polarity.html">polarity</a>. One of the electrodes in some "classical two-electrode" cells can also be considered a "working" ("measuring", "indicator", or "sensing") electrode, e.g., in a <a href="potentiometry.html">potentiometric</a> electroanalytical setup where the <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a> of the measuring electrode (against a <a href="reference electrode.html">reference electrode</a>) is a measure of the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of a species in the solution. Abbreviated as "WE".</p>
