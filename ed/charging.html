A process to "fill" a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> or a <a href="capacitor.html">capacitor</a> with electricity by applying a <a href="current.html">current</a> to its <a href="terminal.html">terminals</a>. In a battery, this process will cause <a href="electrochemical reaction.html">electrochemical reactions</a> to occur <a href="energy storage.html">storing</a> the electricity in chemical form. In contrast, during the charging of a capacitor the electricity is stored as <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charges</a>, without causing any chemical reactions to occur. Opposite: <a href="discharging.html">discharging</a>.
