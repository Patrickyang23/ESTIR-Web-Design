            <h2>porous electrode</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> consisting of a highly porous solid. This is often used in <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cells</a> with gaseous <a href="reactant.html">reactants</a>. In this case, the <a href="charge-transfer reaction.html">charge-transfer reaction</a> proceeds mainly at the triple interface (three-phase boundary) formed by the electrode material, the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a>, and the gaseous reactant. The pores of the structure are partly filled by the electrolyte and partly by the gas. A porous electrode provides a much larger area for reaction than a solid electrode with the gas bubbled around it. A porous electrode can also be used as a <a href="flow-through electrode.html">flow-through electrode</a>.
