The electrical potential difference between two point in a circuit is the cause of the flow of a <a href="current.html">current</a>. It is somewhat analogous to the difference in height in a waterfall that causes the water to fall, or the difference in pressure in a pipeline that causes the gas to flow. In electrochemistry we typically cannot measure "absolute" potentials, only the "difference" of potential between two points. For similar concepts, see <a href="electromotive force.html">electromotive force (emf)</a> and <a href="voltage.html">voltage</a>. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, in electrochemistry "emf" usually refers to the potential difference between the two <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> when there is no <a href="current.html">current</a> flowing through the cell, "voltage" refers to same with current flowing, and "potential" is usually used in connection with electrodes (see <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a>). The measurement unit of the potential is the <a href="volt.html">volt</a>.
