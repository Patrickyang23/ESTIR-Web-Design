Quinhydrone electrode is a <a href="redox electrode.html">redox electrode</a> used for measuring <a href="pH.html">pH</a>. An inert metal (usually platinum) is immersed into the solution to be analyzed and a small amount of quinhydrone crystals is added to the solution. Quinhydrone is slightly soluble in water, dissolving to form a mixture of two substances, with each of the two substances easily <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized or reduced</a> to the other. The <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a> at the inert <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> depends on the ratio of the <a href="concentration.html">concentrations</a> of two substances, which, in turn, depends on the pH.
