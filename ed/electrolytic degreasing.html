Process for removal of grease, oil, etc from metal surfaces in preparation for <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a>. The metal is made the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> containing strongly <a href="base.html">basic</a> (sometimes hot) solution that dissolves these coatings. The strong <a href="hydrogen evolution reaction.html">hydrogen evolution</a> occurring on the cathode may <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduce</a> some of the coatings, and the strong bubble evolution removes the coatings mechanically, while the agitation of the solution helps the chemical dissolution of the coatings by the base. Also called: "electrolytic cleaning", "electrochemical cleaning", "electrocleaning", and "electrochemical degreasing". See also <a href="degreasing.html">degreasing</a>.
