            <h2>current efficiency</h2>
            
The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage, of the <a href="current.html">current</a> passing through an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> (or an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a>) that accomplishes the desired chemical reaction. Inefficiencies may arise from reactions other than the intended reaction taking place at the electrodes, or side reactions consuming the product. The expected production can be theoretically calculated and compared with the actual production.
