A <a href="galvanic cell.html">galvanic cell</a> in which the chemical <a href="energy.html">energy</a> <a href="energy conversion.html">converted</a> into <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a> is arising from the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> difference of a species at the two <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> of the cell. An example is a <a href="divided cell.html">divided cell</a> consisting of two silver electrodes surrounded by silver nitrate solutions of different concentrations. Nature will tend to equalize the concentrations. Consequently, silver <a href="cation.html">cations</a> will be spontaneously <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduced</a> to silver metal at the electrode (<a href="cathode.html">cathode</a>) in the higher concentration solution, while the silver electrode (<a href="anode.html">anode</a>) in the lower concentration solution will be <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> to silver cations. <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">Electrons</a> will be flowing through the external circuit (from the anode or negative electrode to the cathode or positive electrode) producing a <a href="current.html">current</a>, and nitrate <a href="anion.html">anions</a> will <a href="diffusion.html">diffuse</a> through the <a href="separator.html">separator</a>. This process will continue till the silver nitrate concentration is equalized in the two compartments of the cell.
