            <h2>hanging-mercury-drop electrode</h2>
            
A variation of the <a href="dropping-mercury electrode.html">dropping-mercury electrode</a>, where the mercury is not flowing continuously. A "hanging drop" is formed at the end of the <a href="capillary.html">capillary</a> and is used as a <a href="working electrode.html">working electrode</a>. The advantage of this electrode arrangement is that the droplet can easily be renewed by feeding some mercury if the electrode surface becomes contaminated. Also called "static-mercury-drop electrode". Abbreviated as "hmde".
