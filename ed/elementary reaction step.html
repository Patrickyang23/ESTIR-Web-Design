            <h2>elementary reaction step</h2>
            
Chemical reactions usually take place in a number of simple ("elementary") reaction steps proceeding in series. The overall reaction is the sum of the elementary reactions. E.g., the <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a> of copper on some metal involves three elementary steps: (1) a <a href="redox reaction.html">redox</a> reaction in which the double positively <a href="electrical charge.html">charged</a> copper <a href="cation.html">cation</a> reacts with an <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electron</a> from the metal <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> to form a single charged copper <a href="ion.html">ion</a>, followed by (2) a <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">metal deposition reaction</a> in which the single charged copper ion reacts with a second electron to form a copper <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">atom</a> on the surface of the metal, and finally (3) an <a href="electrocrystallization.html">electrocrystallization</a> step in which the copper atom becomes incorporated into the crystalline structure of the underlying metal. The <a href="rate-determining step.html">rate-determining step</a> in copper deposition is usually the first of these steps.
