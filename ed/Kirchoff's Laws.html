            <h2>Kirchoff's Laws</h2>
            
The "current" law states that at any point in an electrical circuit, which does not represent a <a href="capacitor.html">capacitor</a>, the sum of <a href="current.html">currents</a> flowing towards that point is equal to the sum of currents flowing away from that point. That is, there is no <a href="electrical charge.html">charge</a> accumulation at any point in the circuit. The "voltage" law states that the directed sum of the <a href="electrical potential.html">electrical potential</a> differences around any closed circuit must be zero. That is, there is no <a href="voltage.html">voltage</a> accumulation in the circuit.
