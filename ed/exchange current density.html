At the <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> there is no <a href="net current (density).html">net current</a> flowing through the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a>. However, the <a href="equilibrium.html">equilibrium</a> is a dynamic one, that is, the <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> proceeds at "equal rates" both in the forward and in the reverse direction, resulting in a zero "net" reaction rate and a zero "net" current. The rate of the electrode reaction can be expressed as an equivalent <a href="current density.html">current density</a> and the "exchange current density" of a reaction is the current density flowing "equally" in both directions in equilibrium. A large exchange current density indicates a fast reaction (see also <a href="non-polarizable electrode.html">non-polarizable electrode</a>), while a small exchange current density indicates a slow reaction (see also <a href="polarizable electrode.html">polarizable electrode</a>)
