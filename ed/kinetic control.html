An <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> is considered to be under "kinetic control" when the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the rate of the reaction itself rather than the rate of the <a href="mass transport.html">mass transport</a> (mostly by <a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a>) of the <a href="reactant.html">reactants</a> to the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surface or the <a href="ir drop.html">ir drop</a> in the solution. This situation occurs when the the mass transpot/diffusion rate is much faster than the reaction rate and the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of the rectants at the surface of the electrode is practically the same as in the bulk solution. Contrast with <a href="diffusion control.html">diffusion control</a> and <a href="ohmic control.html">ohmic control</a>.
