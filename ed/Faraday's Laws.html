            <h2>Faraday's Laws</h2>
            
Some of the most fundamental laws of electrochemistry discovered by Faraday in 
the 1830's. They are usually stated as: (1) In any electrolytic process the amount of chemical change produced is proportional of the total amount of <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charge</a> passed through the cell. (2) The mass of the chemicals changed is proportional to the chemicals' <a href="equivalent weight.html">equivalent weight</a>. The proportionality constant being the <a href="Faraday Number (Faraday constant).html">Faraday Number</a>.
