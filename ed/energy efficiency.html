For a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery:</a> the fraction, usually expressed as a percentage, of the <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a> <a href="energy storage.html">stored</a> in a battery by <a href="charging.html">charging</a> that is recoverable during <a href="discharging.html">discharging</a>. For an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell:</a> the fraction, usually expressed as a percentage, calculated as the theoretically required energy divided by the energy actually consumed in the process (production of a chemical, <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a>, etc). Inefficiencies arise from <a href="current efficiency.html">current inefficiencies</a> and the inevitable heat losses due to <a href="polarization.html">polarization</a>.
