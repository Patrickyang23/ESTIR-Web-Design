            <h2>diffusion control</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> is considered to be under "diffusion control" when the overall rate of the reaction is is controlled by the rate of the <a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a> of the <a href="reactant.html">reactants</a> to the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surface rather than the rate of the reaction itself or the <a href="ir drop.html">ir drop</a> in the solution. This situation occurs when the diffusion rate is much slower than the reaction rate and the diffusional process cannot supply the reactants fast enough to the surface. Often also called "mass-transport control". Contrast with <a href="kinetic control.html">kinetic control</a> and <a href="ohmic control.html">ohmic control</a>.
