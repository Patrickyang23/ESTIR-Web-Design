            <h2>standard hydrogen electrode</h2>
            
The most fundamental <a href="reference electrode.html">reference electrode</a> in electrochemistry. "By definition" its <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> is considered zero at any temperature, because this electrode was chosen as an arbitrary zero point for <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potentials</a>. A zero point is needed since the potential of a single electrode cannot be measured, only the difference of two electrode potentials is measurable. All electrode potentials are expressed on this "hydrogen scale". It is a <a href="hydrogen electrode.html">hydrogen electrode</a> with an <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> containing unit <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of hydrogen <a href="ion.html">ions</a> and <a href="solubility.html">saturated</a> with hydrogen gas at unit atmosphere pressure. This electrode can be somewhat inconvenient to use because of the need to supply hydrogen gas. Therefore, other reference electrodes (e.g., <a href="calomel electrode.html">calomel</a> or <a href="silver_silver-chloride electrode.html">silver/silver chloride</a>) are often used instead, but the measured electrode potentials can be converted to the "hydrogen scale". Abbreviated as "SHE". Also called "normal hydrogen electrode".
