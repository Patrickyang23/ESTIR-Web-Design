The electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance is an extremely sensitive mass sensor, capable of measuring mass changes in the <a href="micro.html">micro</a><a href="gram.html">gram</a> to <a href="nano.html">nano</a>gram range. It is a piezoelectric (the property exhibited by some non-<a href="conductor (electrical).html">conducting</a> crystals of becoming electrically <a href="polarization.html">polarized</a> when mechanically strained and of becoming mechanically strained when an <a href="electrical field.html">electric field</a> is applied) device, fabricated of a thin plate of quartz with an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> attached (deposited) on the plate. It produces an <a href="ac.html">ac</a> electrical signal with a <a href="frequency.html">frequency</a> that depends on the mass of the crystal. Consequently, it can be used to follow the changes of the mass of an electrode during electrochemical processes, (e.g., during a <a href="cyclic voltammetry.html">cyclic voltammetry</a> measurement) allowing thus investigation of electrochemical <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">deposition/dissolution</a>, <a href="underpotential deposition.html">underpotential deposition</a>, <a href="adsorption.html">adsorption</a> of different substances, <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation</a> of the electrode metal, <a href="electropolymerization.html">electropolymerization</a>, etc. This can provide important information complementary to the electrical information of the measurements for processes occurring in <a href="electroplating.html">electroplating</a>, <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a>, <a href="battery.html">batteries</a>, etc. Abbreviated as "EQCM".
