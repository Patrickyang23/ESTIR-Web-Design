The external electrical connection posts of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> to which a <a href="electrical source (supply).html">power source</a> or a <a href="load.html">load</a> can be connected. For example, in case of a <a href="battery.html">battery</a>, to which either a <a href="load.html">load</a> (e.g., motor, light bulb) can be connected to use the electrical energy of the battery, or to which a <a href="charger.html">charger</a> can be connected to charge the battery. Every battery has only two terminals (positive and negative) independent whether the battery contains one or more cells internally. This term is also used for <a href="stack.html">cell stacks</a> and for <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cells</a>. A terminal can also be called a "pole".
