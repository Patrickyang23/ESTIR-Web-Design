An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> that has a well known and stable <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium electrode potential</a>. It is used as a reference point against which the <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a> of other electrodes (typically that of the <a href="working electrode.html">working electrode</a> or measuring electrode) can be measured in an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a>. In principle it can be any electrode fulfilling the above requirements. In practice, there are a few commonly-used (and usually commercially-available) electrode assemblies that have an electrode potential independent of the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> used in the cell. For some common reference electrodes see e.g., the <a href="silver_silver-chloride electrode.html">silver/silver-chloride electrode</a>, <a href="calomel electrode.html">calomel electrode</a>, and <a href="hydrogen electrode.html">hydrogen electrode</a>. Abbreviated as "RE".</p>

Strictly speaking, there can be a small change in the potential of these electrodes depending on the electrolyte because the presence of a <a href="liquid-junction potential.html">liquid-junction potential</a>. This is very often (justifiably or not) ignored. The liquid-junction potential is also minimized by the use of high <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> potassium chloride as the filling solution of the reference electrodes, because the <a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a> rate of both <a href="ion.html">ions</a> is very closely the same in these solutions.
