The first (1800) laboratory <a href="electrical source (supply).html">source</a> of electricity, essentially what we would call today a <a href="non-rechargeable battery.html">non-rechargeable battery</a>. Volta assembled (piled up) different metal disks (e.g., silver and zinc) separated by solution soaked pasteboards, repeating the pattern many tens of times. This was essentially a <a href="battery.html">battery</a> containing many <a href="series-coupled cells.html">series-coupled</a> cells providing rather high <a href="cell voltage.html">cell voltage</a> and <a href="current.html">current</a> capabilities, but very short life time.
