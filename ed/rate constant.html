            <h2>rate constant</h2>
            
The rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the <a href="concentration.html">concentrations</a> of all the <a href="reactant.html">reactants</a> taking part in the reaction, with the "rate constant" the proportionality factor. In other words, the rate constant is the rate of the reaction when all reactants are present in unit concentration.
