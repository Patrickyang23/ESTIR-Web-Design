A <a href="non-rechargeable battery.html">non-rechargeable battery</a> that is stored in an "inactive" form until its intended, immediate use. E.g., the battery is stored "dry", and it can be activated by injection of the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a>. Or, a battery operating with molten salt electrolyte is stored at a temperature below the electrolyte melting point, and it is activated by the sudden application of heat to melt the electrolyte. The advantages of such arrangements are an extremely long <a href="shelf life.html">shelf life</a> without practically any loss of <a href="energy storage.html">stored</a> energy, and the possibility to produce a very powerful battery with very reactive chemicals that would otherwise cause a very fast <a href="self discharge.html">self discharge</a>. Most reserve batteries are made for military applications.
