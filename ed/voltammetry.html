            <h2>voltammetry</h2>
            
An electrochemical measuring technique used for <a href="electroanalytical chemistry.html">electrochemical analysis</a>, for the determination of the <a href="kinetics.html">kinetics</a> and <a href="(electrode) reaction mechanism.html">mechanism</a> of <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reactions</a>, and for <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a> studies. "Voltammetry" is a family of techniques with the common characteristics that the <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a> of the <a href="working electrode.html">working electrode</a> is controlled (typically with a <a href="potentiostat.html">potentiostat</a>) and the <a href="current.html">current</a> flowing through the electrode is measured. In one of the most common applications of the technique, the potential is scanned linearly in time; this is called the "linear-sweep voltammetry", "LSV", or "LV". "Cyclic voltammetry (CV)" is a linear-sweep voltammetry with the scan continued in the reverse direction at the end of the first scan, this cycle can be repeated a number of times. In <a href="ac.html">ac</a> voltammetry, an alternating voltage is superimposed on the <a href="dc.html">dc</a> ramp.
