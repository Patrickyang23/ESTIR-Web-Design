The <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a> range where an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> behaves as an <a href="ideal polarized (polarizable) electrode.html">ideal polarized electrode</a>. In this potential range, the electrode potential is not positive enough that any species in the solution could be <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> and the potential is not negative enough that any species could be <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduced</a>. In practical situations, there is almost always a small <a href="residual current (density).html">residual current</a> flowing that is faradaic in nature.
