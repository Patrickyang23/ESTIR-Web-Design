            <h2>electrokinetic effects (electrokinetics)</h2>
            
Phenomena that arise due to a <a href="electrical charge.html">charge</a> separation caused by the relative motion of a solid and liquid phase. A portion of the <a href="Gouy-Chapman model of the double layer.html">Gouy-Chapman diffuse layer</a> is sheared off as the two phases move relative to each other, resulting in a charge separation. The <a href="hydrodynamic boundary layer.html">hydrodynamic boundary layer</a> remains attached to the solid surface while the rest of the liquid moves separately; consequently, electrokinetic effects arise when the "diffuse double layer" is thicker that the "hydrodynamic boundary layer". The <a href="electrical potential.html">electrical potential</a> difference between the bulk solution and the "shear plane" is the "electrokinetic potential", often called the "zeta potential". Two types of effects arise: an electrical potential difference will arise between the two phases if they move relative to each other due to an external force (streaming potential and sedimentation potential) or a movement of the two phases will arise relative to each other if an electrical potential is applied parallel to the phase boundary (electroosmosis and electrophoresis). Accordingly, "electrokinetics" includes the following four "electrokinetic effects:"<br/>
<em>Streaming potential</em> arises when liquid is flowing by a solid surface, e.g., when liquid is forced through a <a href="capillary.html">capillary</a> tubing or porous solid by a pressure differential.<br/>
<em>Sedimentation potential</em> arises when small suspended particles move through a liquid (e.g., forced by gravity). This can occur in "dispersions" (suspended solid particles) or "emulsions" (suspended immiscible liquid droplets). Also called "eletrophoretic potential" or "Dorn potential".<br/>
<em>Electroosmosis</em> is the movement of a liquid through a capillary tubing or porous solid driven by an <a href="electrical potential.html">electrical potential</a> difference. Also called "electroendosmosis".<br/>
<em>Electrophoresis</em> is the movement of small suspended particles in a liquid driven by an electrical potential difference. This can occur in "dispersions" (suspended solid particles) or "emulsions" (suspended immiscible liquid droplets). Also called "cataphoresis".<br/>
