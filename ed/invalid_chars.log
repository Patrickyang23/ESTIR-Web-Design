  Character: '�' (ASCII: Replacement)
  Line Content: Temperature scale starting with zero at the �absolute zero�, the physically achievable coldest temperature. The absolute zero is at -273.16<sup>o</sup>C (-459.67<sup>o</sup>F). It is expressed in �Kelvin� (K), which has the graduation of the Celsius (centigrade) scale, consequently, water freezes at 273.16 K and boils at 373.16 K.

  Character: '�' (ASCII: Replacement)
  Line Content: In an �n-type� semiconductor, the movement of <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">electrons</a> in the conduction band carries the <a href="current.html">current</a>. The energy level of the electrons is higher in the �conduction band� than in the �valence band�, the two are being separated by a �band gap�, an energy range where electrons are not allowed. The valence band is typically filled with electrons, but if sufficient energy is supplied (for example, by light absorption) electrons can be moved to the conduction band. This leaves back �holes� in the valence band, which �move� in the opposite directions to the movement of electrons as they hop into the holes. Therefore, the �hole current� is considered a positive current. Such semiconductors are called �p-type�.
