            <h2>adsorption</h2>
            
An increase of the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of a <a href="solute.html">solute</a> in the vicinity of a solid surface, over that in the bulk of the solution, due to the attractive interaction between the solid immersed into the solution and the solute. Adsorption on a solid from a gaseous phase also occurs. It is generally considered to be a physical process, contrast with <a href="chemisorption.html">chemisorption</a>. It is a surface process, not to be confused with <a href="absorption.html">absorption</a>. Opposite: <a href="desorption.html">desorption</a>.
