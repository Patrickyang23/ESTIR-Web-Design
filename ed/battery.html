A device that <a href="energy storage.html">stores</a> <a href="electrical energy.html">electrical energy</a> using <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cells</a>. Chemical reactions occur spontaneously at the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> when they are connected trough an external circuit, producing an electrical <a href="current.html">current</a>. The physical construction of the battery is such that it does not permit the intermixing and consequent direct reaction of the chemicals stored in it.
