            <h2>electroporation</h2>
            
The application of very brief, carefully controlled, pulsed, rotating <a href="electrical field.html">electrical fields</a> to cells, a process that causes pores to open in the cell membrane and allows pharmaceuticals (electrochemotherapy) or genes (electrogenetherapy) to gain access to the cell's interior. The increase of the permeability of the membrane was found to be temporary and was found to have little or no effect on the viability of the cell.
