<a href="capacitor.html">Capacitor</a>-like behavior of some <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> systems. An example is an <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> that is limited to a monolayer on the electrode surface by surface coverage effects. For these systems, the <a href="electrode potential.html">electrode potential</a> varies almost linearly with surface coverage, that is with the <a href="electrical charge.html">charge</a> passed during the reaction (similarly to a capacitor).
