            <h2>hydrogen oxidation reaction</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> in which hydrogen gas is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a> at the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> of an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> to produce hydrogen <a href="ion.html">ions</a>. Abbreviated as "hor". It is a very important and much studied electrode reaction because it occurs at the anode of many <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cells</a> where hydrogen is the fuel. It is the reverse reaction of <a href="hydrogen evolution reaction.html">hydrogen evolution</a>.
