            <h2>potentiostat</h2>
            
An electronic instrument that controls the electrical <a href="electrical potential.html">potential</a> difference between the <a href="working electrode.html">working</a> and <a href="reference electrode.html">reference</a> electrodes of a <a href="three-electrode cell.html">three-electrode cell</a> at a preset value. It forces whatever <a href="current.html">current</a> is necessary to flow between the <a href="working electrode.html">working</a> and <a href="counter electrode.html">counter</a> electrodes to keep the desired potential, as long as the needed <a href="cell voltage.html">cell voltage</a> and current do not exceed the <a href="compliance limits.html">compliance limits</a> of the potentiostat. The working electrode is usually kept at "ground" potential, although, with some potentiostats, it can be "floating".
