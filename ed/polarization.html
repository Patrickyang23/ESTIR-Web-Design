            <h2>polarization</h2>
            
The change of <a href="electrode potential.html">potential</a> of an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> from its <a href="equilibrium electrode potential.html">equilibrium potential</a> upon the application of a <a href="current.html">current</a>. See <a href="overpotential.html">overpotential</a> for a more detailed description. Somewhat confusingly, the term "polarization" is often also used in place of <a href="overvoltage.html">overvoltage</a>. In bioelectrochemistry: the separation and grouping of opposite <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charges</a> (usually across a biological cell membrane) so that two clear groups are perceptible as two distinct poles. Similarly, the term in general means the separation and grouping of opposite electrical charges (across any material) so that two clear groups are perceptible as two distinct poles.
