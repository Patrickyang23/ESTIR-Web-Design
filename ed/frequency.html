The frequency of an <a href="current.html">alternating (ac) current</a> is a measure of how many times the direction of the current flow changes, in the same direction, per second. As the direction of flow changes back and forth, the total number of directional changes, per second, is twice the frequency. The frequency of the household current is 60 hertz. The measurement unit of the frequency is the <a href="hertz.html">hertz</a>.
