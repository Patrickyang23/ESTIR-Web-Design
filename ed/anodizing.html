            <h2>anodizing</h2>
            
A process to produce an oxide film or coating on metals and alloys by <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a>. The metal to be treated is made the <a href="anode.html">anode</a> in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> and its surface is electrochemically <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidized</a>. Anodization can improve certain surface properties, such as <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion</a> resistance, abrasion resistance, hardness, appearance, etc. One metal very often anodized is aluminum, all the above properties improve, furthermore, since the surface film is porous, the aluminum metal can even be colored by the application of pigments or dies in the pores.
