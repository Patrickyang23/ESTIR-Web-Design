            <h2>capacitive current (density)</h2>
            
The <a href="current.html">current</a> (or <a href="current density.html">current density</a>) flowing through an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> that is charging/discharging the <a href="electrical double layer.html">electrical double layer capacitance</a>. This current does not involve any chemical reactions (<a href="charge-transfer reaction.html">charge transfer</a>), it only causes accumulation (or removal) of <a href="electrical charge.html">electrical charges</a> on the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> and in the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> solution near the electrode. There is always some capacitive current flowing when the <a href="electrical potential.html">potential</a> of an electrode is changing, and the capacitive current is generally zero when the potential is constant. Also called "non-faradaic" or "double-layer" current. Contrast with <a href="faradaic current (density).html">faradaic current</a>.
