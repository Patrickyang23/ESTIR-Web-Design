            <h2>homogeneous charge-transfer reaction</h2>
            
A <a href="charge-transfer reaction.html">charge-transfer reaction</a> with both reactants present in the same phase. Typically both reactants are dissolved species in a solution while the <a href="electrical charge.html">charge</a> is transferred from one to the other. Contrast with <a href="heterogeneous charge-transfer reaction.html">heterogeneous charge-transfer reaction</a>.
