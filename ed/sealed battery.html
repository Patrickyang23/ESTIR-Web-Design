See <a href="maintenance-free battery.html"> maintenance-free battery</a>. A <a href="rechargeable battery.html">battery</a> which can be operated without regard to position. This construction is designed to prevent <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> loss through evaporation, spillage, and gassing and this in turn prolongs the life of the battery and eases maintenance. This design often uses vent caps on the cells to let gases escape in extreme conditions. Gassing needs to be reduced by impeding the release to the atmosphere of the oxygen and hydrogen generated during <a href="charging.html">charging</a> (see <a href="oxygen evolution reaction.html">oxygen evolution reaction</a> and <a href="hydrogen evolution reaction.html">hydrogen evolution reaction</a>). This usually involves a <a href="catalyst.html">catalyst</a> that causes the hydrogen and oxygen to recombine into water and is called a recombinant system. Because spillage of the <a href="acid.html">acid</a> electrolyte is eliminated the batteries are also safer. See also <a href="SLA battery.html">SLA battery</a>.
