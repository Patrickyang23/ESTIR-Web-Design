A "chromatographic" separation method with the "mobile", liquid phase forced through the "immobile" phase by the application of an <a href="electrical potential.html">electrical potential</a> difference, that is, by <a href="electroosmosis.html">electroosmosis</a>. In some cases, the separation is enhanced by <a href="electrophoresis.html">electrophoresis</a>. Chromatography is an analytical (see <a href="electroanalytical chemistry.html">electroanalytical)</a> separation technique based on the different attraction of the sample components to an immobile/stationary phase through which the sample solution is forced through by a flow of solvent. The sample components are <a href="adsorption.html">adsorbed</a>/<a href="desorption.html">desorbed</a> on the surface of the stationary phase as they are flushed through by the solvent; consequently, they move with speeds inversely proportional to their adsorption strengths and become separated: the least-strongly adsorbed component is flushed out first and the most-strongly adsorbed last. A variety of stationary phases can be employed; the most common ones are: paper, thin layer of gelatinous material, or a column (or <a href="capillary.html">capillary</a>) packed with small particles.
