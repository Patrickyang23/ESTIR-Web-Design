            <h2>oxygen reduction reaction</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode reaction.html">electrode reaction</a> in which oxygen gas is <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduced</a> at the <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> of an <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a>. The product of the reduction can be hydroxyl (OH<sup>-</sup>) <a href="ion.html">ions</a> or water <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a> (or occasionally hydrogen peroxide molecules). Abbreviated as "orr". It is the reverse reaction of <a href="oxygen evolution reaction.html">oxygen evolution</a>. It is a very important and much studied electrode reaction because it occurs at the cathode of practically all <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cells</a> and it occurs at the cathode of many (though not all) <a href="corrosion.html">corrosion cells</a>.
