            <h2>electrophoretic deposition (painting)</h2>
            
Deposition of particles carried to a surface by <a href="electrophoresis.html">electrophoresis</a>. The loosely formed deposit layer typically needs compacting that can partially occur by <a href="electroosmosis.html">electroosmotic</a> removal of the liquid, or by other means. <a href="electrode reaction.html">Electrode reactions</a> occurring on the substrate surface can take part in "binding" the coating. Practical applications are surface coating and paint deposition (practiced on large scale in the automotive industry) and fabrication of ceramic products. Also called "electrocoating".
