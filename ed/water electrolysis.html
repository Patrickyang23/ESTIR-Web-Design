Process for the electrochemical decomposition of water in a <a href="divided cell.html">divided</a> <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> by <a href="electrolysis.html">electrolysis</a>. Typically, hydrogen gas is produced at the steel <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> (see <a href="hydrogen evolution reaction.html">hydrogen evolution</a>) and oxygen gas is produced at the nickel <a href="anode.html">anode</a> (see <a href="oxygen evolution reaction.html">oxygen evolution</a>). The cell is divided to avoid mixing the hydrogen and oxygen gases. The <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> is typically an <a href="aqueous solution.html">aqueous</a> potassium hydroxide solution. Potassium hydroxide is used to provide a large <a href="ionic conductor.html">ionic conductivity</a>, even though the potassium is not reacting at any of the <a href="electrode.html">electrodes</a> (see <a href="supporting electrolyte.html">supporting electrolyte)</a>.
