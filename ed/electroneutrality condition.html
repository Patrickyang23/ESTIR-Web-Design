            <h2>electroneutrality condition</h2>
            
The expression of nature's tendency to keep any system electrically <a href="neutralization.html">neutral</a>, that is, if it contains <a href="electrical charge.html">electrically charged</a> particles the total sum of negative charges will be equal to the total sum of positive charges. Applying this condition to a solution of <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolytes</a> implies the equality of the total positive <a href="ion.html">ionic</a> charges to the total negative ionic charges. This equality should hold even as we subdivide the solution into smaller and smaller volume elements.
