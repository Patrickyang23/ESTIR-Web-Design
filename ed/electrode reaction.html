            <h2>electrode reaction</h2>
            
A chemical "half" (or "partial") reaction occurring at the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surface. It is called a "half" (or "partial") reaction because only the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation</a> or the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">reduction</a> part of the overall <a href="cell reaction.html">cell reaction</a> occurs at any one electrode. See also <a href="electrochemical reaction.html">electrochemical reaction</a>. Many electrode reactions can proceed either as oxidation or as reduction, depending on the direction of the <a href="current.html">current</a> flowing through the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a>/<a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> interface. See, e.g. <a href="metal deposition_dissolution.html">metal deposition/dissolution</a> or <a href="redox reaction.html">redox</a> reactions.
