An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> that is shared by two <a href="series-coupled cells.html">series-coupled</a> <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cells</a> in such a way that one side of the (usually planar) electrode acts as an <a href="anode.html">anode</a> in one cell and the other side acts as a <a href="cathode.html">cathode</a> in the other cell. In storage <a href="battery.html">batteries</a> and <a href="fuel cell.html">fuel cell</a> stacks many cells are usually connected internally, and it is a very efficient design feature to use a single planar structure for electrodes in two neighboring cells and also as the electrical interconnection between them.
