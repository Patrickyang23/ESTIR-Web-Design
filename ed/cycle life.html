The number of times a <a href="rechargeable battery.html">rechargeable battery</a> (or a <a href="capacitor.html">capacitor</a>, especially an <a href="electrochemical capacitor.html">electrochemical capacitor</a>) can be "cycled" (<a href="charging.html">charged</a> and <a href="discharging.html">discharged</a>) before it loses its ability to accept <a href="electrical charge.html">charge</a>. The processes occurring in the battery are not completely "chemically" <a href="reversible electrode reaction.html">reversible</a>, and after repeated charging/discharging the battery will accept less and less charge till it becomes useless as a practical <a href="energy storage.html">energy storage</a> device. Some batteries can be recharged hundreds to thousands times.
