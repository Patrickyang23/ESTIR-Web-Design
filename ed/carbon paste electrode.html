            <h2>carbon paste electrode</h2>
            
An <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> prepared from graphite powder and some binding liquid. It is often used because it is inexpensive and can be easily renewed by removing the top surface. The long term stability is questionable and the binder may cause interference. Abbreviated as CPE. See an <a href="../encycl/art-c01-carbon.htm">Encyclopedia Article</a>.
