            <h2>separator</h2>
            
A thin structural material (usually a sheet) used to separate the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> of a <a href="divided cell.html">divided</a> <a href="electrochemical cell.html">electrochemical cell</a> into two or more compartments. A separator is typically either a membrane or a diaphragm. The distinction between these two separators is somewhat blurred. A membrane typically has very small pores that permit only <a href="diffusion.html">diffusional</a> or <a href="electromigration.html">conductive</a> motion of the solvent or the <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> from one compartment to another. A diaphragm has larger pores so that it permits the flow (see <a href="convection.html">convection</a>) of the electrolyte solution from one compartment to another but still restricts the complete intermixing the two solutions.
