            <h2>highly ordered pyrolytic graphite</h2>
            
A high purity form of carbon, with a renewable and almost atomically smooth surface. Often used as a <a href="working electrode.html">working electrode</a>. It has a lamellar/layered structure and it cleaves almost like mica. Its structure shows hexagonal rings that are the true structure of graphite. Abbreviated as "HOPG".
