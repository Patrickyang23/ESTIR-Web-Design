            <h2>diffusion layer</h2>
            
A thin liquid <a href="hydrodynamic boundary layer.html">boundary layer</a> at the surface of an <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> that is immobile. This is part of a rather simplified and not strictly correct model (originally proposed by the early electrochemist Nernst, and is often called the "nernstian hypothesis") that works surprisingly well in most cases. The <a href="electrolyte.html">electrolyte</a> solution is divided into three distinct parts: the bulk solution and the two diffusion layers at the surfaces of the electrodes. The bulk solution is assumed to be so well stirred that the <a href="concentration.html">concentration</a> of all species is uniform throughout. In this region, <a href="mass transport.html">mass transport</a> occurs only through <a href="convection.html">convection</a>. While in the diffusion layers mass transport occurs through <a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a>. The thickness of the diffusion layer can vary typically between the order of 0.01 <a href="centimeter.html">centimeter</a> in a stagnant solution and the order of 0.0001 centimeter in very well-stirred solution. (The diffusion layer is not to be confused with the <a href="diffuse double layer.html">diffuse layer</a>.)
