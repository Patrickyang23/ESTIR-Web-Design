            <h2>gram-mole</h2>
            
An amount of a compound equal in <a href="gram.html">grams</a> to its <a href="molecular weight.html">molecular weight</a>. E.g., the molecular weight of water is 18, so 18 grams of water is called a gram-mole of water. This provides an <a href="atom, atomic structure (proton, neutron, electron).html">atomistically</a> fundamental unit because one gram-mole of any material will contain the same number of <a href="molecule.html">molecules</a> (this is a very large number, called "Avogadro's" number). One gram-mole of hydrogen gas contains the exactly same number of molecules as one gram-mole of table salt (sodium chloride), even though the latter is much heavier. The simplified expression of "mole" is often used in place of "gram-mole" and also in place of <a href="gram-atom.html">gram-atom</a>. It is usually obvious from the context which meaning is appropriate. The measurement unit and symbol of the "gram-mole" or "mole" is the "mol".
