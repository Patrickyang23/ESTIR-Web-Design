            <h2>indirect electrolysis</h2>
            
The production of chemicals in an <a href="electrolytic cell.html">electrolytic cell</a> through <a href="intermediate.html">intermediate</a> electrolysis products. It is often used in the <a href="oxidation_reduction.html">oxidation/reduction</a> of organic compounds that would otherwise react very slowly at the <a href="electrode.html">electrode</a> surface. An intermediate oxidizing/reducing agent (a <a href="redox couple.html">redox couple</a>) is produced at the electrode surface and the agent reacts with the organic in the bulk solution. The agent is continuously regenerated by the electrolysis. A typical oxidizing agent is the ferric (tri-valent iron) <a href="ion.html">ion</a>, and an example of the reducing agent is the cerous (tri-valent cerium) ion. The reactive intermediate is often called a "redox mediator", and the overall reaction a "redox mediated reaction".
